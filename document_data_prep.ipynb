Kathy Castor [chairwoman of the committee] \\npresiding.\\n    Present: Representatives Castor, Lujan, Bonamici, Brownley, \\nHuffman, McEachin, Levin, Casten, Graves, Carter, and Miller.\\n    Ms. Castor. The committee will come to order. Good \\nafternoon, everyone.\\n    Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare a \\nrecess of the committee at any time.\\n    Welcome to our hearing, entitled ``Solving the Climate \\nCrisis: Building a Vibrant and Just Clean Energy Economy.''\\n    As a reminder, members participating in this remote hearing \\nshould be visible on camera throughout the hearing. As with in-\\nperson meetings, members control their microphones. Members can \\nbe muted by staff only to avoid inadvertent background noise.\\n    In addition, statements, documents, and motions must be \\nsubmitted to the electronic repository at \\nsccc.repository@mail.house.\\ngov.\\n    Finally, members or witnesses experiencing technical \\nproblems should inform the committee staff immediately.\\n    So thanks again for participating during this somber time, \\nas our colleague and friend, Representative John Lewis, is \\nlying in state here in the U.S. Capitol after a lifetime of \\nstanding up for justice for all, even if that meant sitting \\ndown where some would deny him a seat.\\n    His leadership in the civil rights movement was legendary, \\nbut he worked on every issue when there was a need to encourage \\nAmericans and Congress to do more. That included climate change \\nand environmental justice.\\n    Last year, he said, ``Each and every one of us must cherish \\nthis planet, for it is likely the only home we will ever know. \\nCombating climate change is not a Democratic or a Republican \\nissue. It is a question of preserving this little piece of real \\nestate that we call Earth for generations to come, for \\ngenerations yet unborn. Together, we can solve this problem, \\nbut time is of the essence. Congress cannot stand on the \\nsidelines. We have a moral responsibility to lead, and the time \\nto act is now.''\\n    So, before I ask the committee to observe a moment of \\nsilence to remember Representative Lewis, I wonder if Ranking \\nMember Graves has made it over from his meeting so that he can \\nprovide his thoughts or if any of the Republican members would \\nlike to do so instead.\\n    Mr. Graves. Hey, Chair Castor, this is Garret. Thank you \\nvery much for the opportunity for the certainly appropriate \\nhonoring of John Lewis.\\n    It has been an incredible experience to be able to serve \\nwith someone who has played such an amazing role in the Civil \\nRights Act. You read about these iconic figures, but to be able \\nto serve alongside of him has just been an awing experience.\\n    And it was amazing being in the Rotunda yesterday as his \\nbody lied in state. And just seeing all of the incredible \\nhistory and little anecdotes and stories that folks have shared \\nover the past few days in remembering his courageous leadership \\nand, again, just the progress that he has made in regard to \\nadvancing the civil rights of particularly the African-American \\ncommunity, it has been amazing.\\n    So I appreciate you raising the issue and certainly giving \\na tribute of respect to him.\\n    Ms. Castor. Thank you, Ranking Member Graves.\\n    So, at this time, I would like to ask everyone \\nparticipating here to take a moment to remember the life and \\nlegacy of Representative John Lewis.\\n    [Moment of silence.]\\n    Ms. Castor. Thank you all.\\n    I now recognize myself for 5 minutes to give an opening \\nstatement.\\n    Members, America is reeling from a number of interrelated \\nand severe crises that I believe can be solved through \\ntransformational action and leadership.\\n    First, the coronavirus pandemic, which has tragically taken \\nthe lives of nearly 150,000 Americans, is crying out for a \\ncoordinated plan of action to control the virus and save lives. \\nIt is a sad day for me and Floridians because we set another \\nrecord today for the number of deaths reported, 186 Floridians, \\nthe largest one-day increase so far.\\n    The pandemic has also sparked an economic crisis. Millions \\nof Americans are out of a job as businesses shut down in \\nresponse to the health emergency.\\n    And, in the middle of all this, we witnessed the brutal \\nmurder of George Floyd at the hands of police officers in \\nMinneapolis. It was a tragic reminder that systemic racism \\nstill plagues our communities, and the urgent need for racial \\njustice.\\n    Plus, the ongoing climate crisis continues to fuel extreme \\nevents like floods, intense storms, and wildfires, and it is \\nincreasing the costs on families and businesses alike.\\n    So Congress must rise to the occasion. We must tackle the \\nclimate crisis while heeding the calls for racial justice, \\nprotecting the health of our families, and helping our \\nneighbors get back to work. And we can rebuild our economy in a \\nresilient way that reduces greenhouse gas pollution and \\nprotects the air that we breathe. We have a moral obligation to \\nsolve the climate crisis and build back better for decades to \\ncome.\\n    Solving the climate crisis is hard work, but it is within \\nour reach. Investing in clean energy gives us an opportunity to \\ncreate millions of good-paying jobs, family-sustaining jobs \\nthat will get Americans back to work and strengthen our middle \\nclass. It can also help make communities healthier as we deploy \\ninnovative technologies to reduce pollution. And it can repair \\ninjustices of the past as we commit to invest in Black and \\nBrown communities disproportionately harmed by the climate \\ncrisis.\\n    Today, we will discuss how to build a vibrant clean energy \\neconomy, one that centers environmental justice at its core. We \\nwill hear about ways to grow our manufacturing base and create \\nwell-paying jobs by modernizing our grid. And we will discuss \\ninitiatives to revive our economy while reducing pollution and \\ncreating more resilient communities.\\n    This is our first hearing since Select Committee Democrats \\nreleased our majority staff report, ``Solving the Climate \\nCrisis,''a comprehensive framework to cut carbon pollution in \\nline with what science dictates and create the clean energy \\neconomy that we desperately need.\\n    I would like to thank the thousands of stakeholders who \\ninformed our action plan--the scientists, the farmers, young \\npeople, EJ leaders, workers, indigenous people, and our \\noutstanding professional staff.\\n    According to an independent analysis by Energy Innovation, \\nour plan would save over 60,000 lives every year by 2050 while \\nalso providing at least $8 trillion in climate and health \\nbenefits alone. It would also create economic opportunity by \\ninvesting in America's workers and communities, including \\nestablishing a national economic transition office to help with \\nthe transition to a net-zero emission economy.\\n    I know our Republican colleagues have been reviewing the \\nmajority staff report. I look forward to hearing their \\nrecommendations to help solve the climate crisis. Democrats \\nhave put forward our ideas, and I hope our Republican \\ncolleagues will do the same so the committee can discuss \\npotential bipartisan recommendations in the coming months, \\nespecially since previous staff attempts to start the \\ndiscussions have not progressed.\\n    Workers are at the center of our action plan. Between March \\nand May, more than 620,000 clean energy workers, nearly a fifth \\nof the industry's workforce, filed for unemployment. While the \\nU.S. economy added jobs in June, only about 106,000 of those \\njobs were in clean energy, leaving more than a half a million \\nclean energy workers unemployed.\\n    As you will hear from our witnesses, climate solutions are \\neconomic solutions, and they have helped develop platforms to \\nput workers and families first, addressing injustices in \\nvulnerable communities with an eye toward building a recovery \\non a stronger and more equitable foundation.\\n    As we rebound from our current crises, let's power \\nAmerica's recovery through investments in clean energy, energy \\nefficiency and conservation, and put money back into families' \\npockets at a time when they really could use it. We can expand \\nour manufacturing base and build the technologies the world \\nwill need to solve the climate crisis. We can invest in a 21st-\\ncentury infrastructure that can help cut carbon pollution and \\nwithstand climate impacts. And we can create good-paying jobs \\nthat move us towards net-zero emissions by 2050. I know we can \\ndo this.\\n    At this time, I would like to recognize Ranking Member \\nGraves for an opening statement.\\n    You are recognized for 5 minutes.\\n    [The statement of Ms. Castor follows:]\\n\\n                Opening Statement of Chair Kathy Castor\\n\\n                Hearing on ``Solving the Climate Crisis:\\n           Building a Vibrant and Just Clean Energy Economy''\\n\\n                 Select Committee on the Climate Crisis\\n\\n                             July 28, 2020\\n\\n                        As Prepared for Delivery\\n\\n    America is reeling from a number of interrelated and severe crises \\nthat I believe can be solved through transformational action and \\nleadership.

And we can create jobs, jobs, \\njobs--good-paying jobs that move us toward net-zero emissions by 2050.\\n    With that, I look forward to hearing from our witnesses.\\n\\n    Mr. Graves. Thank you, Madam Chair. Again, I want to thank \\nyou and the committee for putting this hearing together.\\n    As we have discussed on many occasions, I share a lot of \\nthe same objectives--and I know many members of the committee \\ndo--the same objectives that you communicated just a few \\nminutes ago, objectives like improving the resilience of our \\ncommunities, particularly those coastal communities that you \\nrepresent, that we represent. And I also know that Congressman \\nBuddy Carter has been very vocal about us being more deliberate \\nin building upon some of the successes we had in 2018, really \\nextraordinary successes in 2018, in improving the resiliency of \\nour coastal communities.\\n    We share the objectives of building upon some of the \\nextraordinary efforts we have had over the past several years \\nin reducing emissions in the United States, to the point where \\nwe have reduced them more than any other country in the world, \\nand actually bringing even more science to the table to ensure \\nthat we are building upon the successes and the very tactics \\nthat allowed us to be the global leader in emissions reduction, \\nrather than shutting that out, and ensuring that economic \\nscience is part of the equation.\\n    You mentioned that the majority staff report would save $8 \\ntrillion. And, certainly, we do need to consider cost savings \\nas part of the overall calculation to inform the decisions that \\nwe make, the recommendations that we make in regard to energy \\npolicy moving forward. But with an estimate that the \\nimplementation report would cost $20 trillion, that doesn't \\nseem to provide a positive cost-to-benefit ratio.\\n    And, of course, as you mentioned, Congressman John Lewis--\\nand you mentioned our efforts to try to continue to make \\nprogress and build upon the success of Congressman Lewis in \\naddressing the inequality issues. We cannot allow there to be a \\ndisproportionate impact on those that are impoverished or those \\ncommunities of color, a significant percentage of which I \\nrepresent in our south Louisiana district.\\n    The committee report largely reflects a lot of the \\nrecommendations that have been implemented in California, and \\nCalifornia is one of the worst states in the nation in regard \\nto actually reducing emissions. And, also, there is a lawsuit \\nby a community of color against the State of California because \\nof the disproportionate cost imposed on them as a result of \\nthose recommendations. So here you have disproportionate costs \\non communities of color and actually one of the worst \\nperforming emissions reduction strategies in the nation.\\n    So I want to say it again: We must, we must, introduce more \\nscience into this equation--that includes environmental \\nscience, of course chemical science, physical science, and \\neconomic science--to make sure that we are employing the best \\nstrategies.\\n    Last thing, Madam Chair, I just want to make note in regard \\nto your comment about the staff unable to work together to come \\nup with a report, and all I can derive from that is that \\nperhaps you were talking about the majority staff unable to \\nwork together, because our staff was not engaged on any type of \\nbipartisan report.\\n    But, certainly, as I mentioned at the opening, we share a \\nlot of the same objectives: resiliency of our coastal \\ncommunities and other communities, reducing emissions, \\nconservation of energy, and ensuring that the United States \\ncontinues to be a leader but that we don't lead in job losses \\nand we don't lead in providing jobs to China and other \\ncountries, where employing a lot of the strategies included in \\nthe report would actually achieve those goals, sending jobs to \\nChina and giving leverage to China and other nations as opposed \\nto the United States.\\n    So, looking forward to working together, and I yield back.\\n    Ms. Castor. All right.\\n    Without objection, members who wish to enter statements \\ninto the record may have 5 business days to do so.\\n    Ms. Castor. Now I want to welcome our witnesses.\\n    First, Dr. Ana Baptista is an assistant professor and the \\nAssociate Director of the Tishman Environment and Design Center \\nat The New School.

Thank you. Thank you, Chair Castor, Ranking \\nMember Graves, and distinguished members of the committee, for \\nthe opportunity to testify before the House Select Committee on \\nthe Climate Crisis.\\n    The ongoing and intersecting public health, economic, and \\nracial justice crises have put into sharp focus the systemic \\nchanges needed to address longstanding inequalities in our \\ncountry. At the same time, we are in a global climate crisis.\\n    Each of these crises disproportionately impacts communities \\nof color and low-wealth communities around the country. As \\npolicymakers address these multiple intersecting crises, they \\nmust also enact solutions that address them holistically and \\nare centered in equity and justice.\\n    Events in 2020 have shone a bright light on longstanding \\nracial disparities that have contributed to disproportionate \\nhealth and environmental impacts on communities of color and \\nlow-wealth communities.\\n    A recent Harvard study linked long-term exposure to air \\npollution, like particulate matter, to higher death rates from \\ncoronavirus. These findings were supported by the Rhodium \\nGroup, which found that Black, Latino, and indigenous \\ncommunities in high-environmental-risk areas experience death \\nrates from COVID-19 \\nmore than four times higher than those in counties with fewer \\nenvironmental risks and that these same communities of color \\nexperience higher rates of unemployment and slower economic \\nrebound.\\n    Systemic racism has contributed to these disparities, and \\ntransformative policies that center justice and equity are \\nessential to moving forward. Climate policy can and should be \\ndesigned in a manner that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and \\nalso other harmful air pollutants while creating long-term \\neconomic sustainability for all communities. But we need an \\nintentional focus on equity and justice; otherwise, we will \\nreplicate the same disparities in the transition to a \\nsustainable economy.\\n    The House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis majority's \\n``Climate Crisis Action Plan'' details the processes and \\npolicies that, if enacted, will address these crises and build \\na more equitable, just future.\\n    Similarly, the ``Equitable and Just National Climate \\nPlatform'' also identifies the need to advance economic, \\nracial, environmental, and climate justice as part of a \\nnational climate agenda, and, as a co-author of the platform, I \\nam pleased to see many of these ideas reflected in the Select \\nCommittee's report.\\n    We need actions that will end environmental racism and the \\nhistoric concentration of pollution in environmental justice \\ncommunities and that will rebuild the economy so that it works \\nfor all people.\\n    And, meeting the goals and priorities outlined in the plan, \\nwe encourage Congress to support some of the following specific \\nexamples of investments that could have multiple benefits.\\n    For example: investing in equitable and just, collaborative \\nprojects, such as the EPA's Environmental Justice Small Grants \\nProgram.\\n    Expanding environmental investments in vulnerable \\ncommunities, such as climate resilient water infrastructure \\nneeded to deliver safe drinking water or prevent climate \\nrelated flooding.\\n    Expanding low-income solar access, community solar \\ninitiatives, cooperative nonprofit energy organizations' energy \\nefficiency programs, all which spur job creation and economic \\nopportunities in areas that have historically faced barriers.\\n    Making strategic investments in the transportation sector, \\nsuch as zero-emission school buses, heavy- and medium-duty \\ndiesel trucks, can have short-term public health benefits in EJ \\ncommunities while also supporting economic and climate goals.\\n    Increasing investments for worker training programs, like \\nthe NIEHS's Environmental Career Worker Training Program, which \\ncan provide job and safety training to millions of Americans.\\n    Vastly increasing funding for the Energy Efficiency and \\nConservation Block Grants, the Low-Income Home Energy \\nAssistance Program, Community Development Block Grants, and the \\nWeatherization Assistance Program. These investments are not \\nonly going to ensure greater climate resiliency but can address \\nhistoric inequalities, energy insecurity, and climate change.\\n    We could mobilize new investments in safe and healthy \\ncommunities, such as the creation of a national climate bank \\nthat Representative Dingell introduced, and carve out 60 \\npercent of the bank capital for economically disadvantaged \\nareas and communities of color.\\n    These are just some examples of the kinds of investments we \\nneed in these difficult times. We need strategic investments \\nthat can deliver multiple benefits, particularly to those \\ncommunities hardest hit by COVID, racial and economic \\ninequality, and environmental injustice.\\n    We hope that these recommendations embodied in the \\ncommittee's plan will put us on the path to ensuring a healthy \\nand sustainable future for all Americans.\\n    Thank you.\\n    [The statement of Dr. Baptista follows:]\\n\\n                 Select Committee on the Climate Crisis\\n\\n                 Testimony of Ana Isabel Baptista, PhD\\n\\n      Tishman Environment & Design Center at The New School & the \\n               New Jersey Environmental Justice Alliance\\n\\n             Member of the Equitable and Just Climate Forum\\n\\n                             July 27, 2020\\n\\n    Thank you for the opportunity to testify before the House Select \\nCommittee on the Climate Crisis.

At the same time, \\nwe're in a climate crisis. Each of these crises disproportionately \\nimpacts Indigenous, Black, Latinx, Asian Pacific Island and other \\ncommunities of color. As policymakers address each crisis, they must \\nalso look at solutions that address them holistically and are centered \\nin equity and justice.\\n    The House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis' majority Climate \\nCrisis Action Plan\\\\1\\\\ details both processes and policies that, if \\nenacted, will address these crises and build a more equitable and just \\nfuture. The Equitable and Just National Climate Platform\\\\2\\\\ also \\nidentifies the need to advance economic, racial, environmental and \\nclimate justice as part of a national climate agenda, and as a co-\\nauthor of the Platform, I am pleased to see our ideas acknowledged in \\nthe Select Committee report.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ https://climatecrisis.house.gov/report\\n    \\\\2\\\\ https://ajustclimate.org/index.html\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Events in 2020 have shone a bright light on longstanding racial \\ndisparities that have contributed to disproportionate health impacts on \\ncommunities of color and low income communities. A Harvard study\\\\3\\\\ \\nreleased in April linked long-term exposure to air pollution to higher \\ndeath rates from coronavirus--demonstrating the devastating health \\nimpacts caused by decades of environmental racism. These findings were \\nsupported by the Rhodium group,\\\\4\\\\ which found that Black, Latino, and \\nIndigenous communities in high environmental risk areas experience \\ndeath rates from COVID-19 more than four times higher than those in \\ncounties with fewer environmental risks (See Appendix). The Rhodium \\nGroup also found that Indigenous, Black, and Latino communities \\nexperienced higher rates of unemployment and a slower economic rebound \\nthan whites.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\3\\\\ https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/air-\\npollution-linked-with-higher-covid-19-death-rates/\\n    \\\\4\\\\ https://rhg.com/research/a-just-green-recovery/\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Systemic racism has contributed to these disparities, and \\ntransformative, intersectional policy that centers justice and equity \\nin the solutions are essential going forward. Climate policy can and \\nshould be designed in a manner that reduces greenhouse gas emissions \\nand other pollution, while creating long-term economic sustainability \\nfor all communities. Without an intentional focus on equity and \\njustice, we will replicate the same disparities in the transition to an \\nenvironmentally sustainable economy.\\nEquitable and Just National Climate Platform\\n    One year ago, environmental justice organizations from across the \\ncountry along with six national environmental groups co-created and co-\\nsigned the Equitable and Just National Climate Platform (Platform). The \\nPlatform identifies the need to advance innovative, equitable policy \\nsolutions to address climate change and environmental justice. Central \\nto the Platform is the recognition that in order to address the climate \\ncrisis, we must advance policy that addresses climate while advancing \\nenvironmental justice, economic, and racial justice.\\n    The Platform details a bold vision of a just, inclusive agenda that \\nadvances ambitious environmental justice and climate policy while \\naddressing racial and economic justice. As it states, ``Our vision is \\nthat all people and all communities have the right to breathe clean \\nair, live free of dangerous levels of toxic pollution, access healthy \\nfood, and enjoy the benefits of a prosperous and vibrant clean \\neconomy.''\\n    In order to achieve these goals and vision, the Platform recognizes \\nthe need to mobilize all assets--communities, government, science, \\nresearch, business and industry--to develop long-term comprehensive \\nsolutions. These solutions must ``meaningfully involve and value the \\nvoices and positions of environmental justice, frontline and fenceline \\ncommunities.'' These strategies must also ``acknowledge and repair the \\nlegacy of environmental harms on communities inflicted by fossil fuel \\nand other industrial pollution.''\\n    Organizations who co-signed the Platform agreed that in order to \\naddress climate change, we must reduce legacy pollution in a way that \\ncreates jobs and contributes to the health and well-being of all \\ncommunities.\\n    Policies in the Platform will contribute both to short-term \\neconomic recovery in response to the pandemic and recession, as well as \\nlong-term economic growth, building towards an inclusive, pollution-\\nfree economy, all while reducing greenhouse gas and other emissions. We \\nare pleased to see the core premise of the Platform in the Climate \\nCrisis Action Plan.\\nHEROES Act and Representative McEachin and Chairman Grijalva's \\n        environmental justice stimulus letter\\n    A number of existing programs, if robustly funded, would contribute \\nto the just and equitable future envisioned in the Platform. The HEROES \\nAct, as passed by the House, included funding for programs that will \\nhave both short and long-term economic impacts while reducing emissions \\nand creating and sustaining jobs. These include nearly $2 billion to \\nprovide potable water to communities affected by the pandemic, \\nspecifically making funds available to assist Tribal and low-income \\nfamilies with water and wastewater services, in addition to a \\nmoratorium on dangerous water service shut-offs; and $1.5 billion for \\nthe Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to reduce energy \\nburdens for low income families. The bill also included $50 million for \\nenvironmental justice grants to study and address the disproportionate \\nimpacts of coronavirus on environmental justice communities.\\n    Representative McEachin and Chairman Grijalva sent a letter to \\nHouse and Senate leadership in March that also identified key short-\\nterm spending that would reduce emissions and improve public health \\nwhile also stimulating economic growth. Rhodium's jobs analysis of the \\nprograms outlined in the letter found that if funded, these investments \\nwould create up to 300,000 new jobs per year for five years. For \\nexample, Rhodium estimates that a $30 billion investment in the \\nCommunity Development Block Grant program, which provides grants to \\nstates for community development and affordable housing, would create \\n92,000 jobs per year for five years.\\n    Both the letter and the Climate Crisis Action Plan discussed the \\nimportance of expanding funding for the Weatherization Assistance \\nProgram (WAP). By investing in energy efficiency and home updates, \\nindividuals can lower their energy burdens and reduce electricity \\nusage. As the Climate Crisis Action Plan notes, ``Investments in \\nweatherization have economic multiplier effects because workers develop \\nskills through construction-related jobs that are readily transferable \\nto other economic sectors'' (p. 166). They both discuss the Low Income \\nHome Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), and the essential utility bill \\nassistance it provides. The Climate Crisis Action Plan also envisions \\nexpanding LIHEAP and using these funds to increase solar access in low \\nincome communities (p. 77, 167). Both also recommend increasing funding \\nto ``clean up and reuse contaminated properties (brownfields)'' (p. \\n398).\\n    As Rhodium concluded, ``As Congress turns their attention from \\nnear-term relief to investing in a sustainable economic recovery, \\ninvestments in the kinds of programs outlined in the Grijalva-McEachin \\nletter can both make a meaningful contribution to national job creation \\nand serve as a down payment on creating a more environmentally just \\nfuture.''\\nPrioritize Climate Action Spending in EJ communities\\n    As the pandemic and economic challenges continue, the health and \\neconomic wellbeing of Indigenous, Black, and Latino communities have \\nbeen disproportionately impacted. Rhodium found that ``Between February \\nand May, the number of Black and Latino people employed in the US fell \\nby 16% and 18%, respectively, compared to 11% for white people.'' And, \\nas employment showed beginning signs of recovery in May, the same note \\nfound that Black and Latinx employment did not recover as quickly as \\nwhite employment.\\n    With a backdrop of the current economic crisis, these statistics \\nreveal the devastating effects of environmental racism during a global \\npandemic. It is clear that environmental regulation does not equate to \\nhealthy environments for all. As policymakers take action to reduce \\ngreenhouse gas emissions, it is essential for these policies to also \\nreduce legacy environmental and economic impacts and ensure that \\npolicies do not contribute to further harm placed on these communities. \\nCriteria and mechanisms to prioritize investment in disproportionately \\nimpacted communities to address these harms should be included in \\nclimate policy. As the Equitable and Just Climate Platform states, \\n``Strategies to address climate change must not disproportionately \\nbenefit some communities while imposing costs on others. In fact, the \\nnational climate policy agenda should be used to reduce the \\ndisproportionate amount of pollution that is often found in EJ \\ncommunities and that is associated with cumulative impacts, public \\nhealth risks, and other persistent challenges.'' We strongly recommend \\npursuing local economic development and building economic diversity \\nthat will also reduce the vulnerability of overburdened communities to \\npollution. Climate action must ``create and support strategies that \\nshift away from high pollution products and production processes toward \\nthose that are low-emission and sustainable. This also includes \\ninvestments in innovative and worker-supported economic organizations \\nsuch as cooperatives and other community wealth-building strategies.''\\n    Research investments are also necessary to address equity and \\njustice in climate policy. As detailed in the Platform, research \\nfocused on environmental justice and climate equity is a critical \\ncomponent of building a climate-sustainable future that addresses \\ninequities instead of reinforcing inequities.\\nHow to Invest and Prioritize spending in EJ communities\\n    Underpinning all of these policy proposals, is the necessity of \\ncrafting policy inclusively and ensuring benefits are distributed \\nequitably. We support the goal of creating an inclusive, just, and \\npollution-free energy economy. In the Equitable and Just Climate \\nPlatform, we call for ``investing in the development of innovative \\ndecentralized models of energy provision; community governance and \\nownership; incorporation of social and health benefits into energy \\nsystems planning; incentivizing the inclusion of equity into future \\nenergy investment through public programs; and supporting public and \\nprivate research and development to include equity considerations in \\nnew technology development.''\\n    One key recommendation made in the Climate Crisis Action Plan is \\nthat ``Congress should direct EPA to create a plan to (1) develop a \\nmethodology to assess the cumulative and disproportionate impacts of \\npollution on environmental justice communities, and (2) integrate that \\nmethodology into agency decision-making'' (p. 304). This critical first \\nstep is necessary to ensure that policy to address climate reduces \\npollution in overburdened communities.\\n    Both the Platform and the Climate Crisis Action Plan recognize the \\nimportance of environmental justice community participation in \\npolicymaking. The Climate Crisis Action Plan's recommendation to \\nincrease funding for EPA existing programs that provide technical \\nassistance and build capacity of stakeholders engaged in policy is \\nequally important. Throughout the Plan, the Committee majority \\nrecommends developing policy in partnership with communities. This \\nmodel of policymaking will ensure that community expertise is taken \\ninto account, and that policies are responsive to community priorities.\\n    Creating an equitable, just and climate-sustainable economy will \\ndrive job growth and sustained investments by government as well as \\nprivate entities. The Platform details the need for policies to be \\nshaped by communities and must lead to benefits at the local and \\ncommunity level. It also recognized the need to realign government \\nspending in order to accomplish these goals. It envisions working at \\nmultiple levels of government using a variety of policy tools. \\nSpecifically, the Platform favors ``policy tools that help achieve both \\nlocal and national emissions reductions of carbon and other forms of \\npollution.'' This shift will ``require substantial new forms of capital \\ninvestment by both the public and private sectors to build a new \\nnational infrastructure as well as democratic community participation \\nto help set infrastructure investment priorities.'' Without proper \\ninvestment and engagement, we will repeat mistakes of the past.\\n    The Climate Crisis Action Plan recommends significant federal \\ninvestments to update infrastructure and housing to reduce emissions \\nand build climate resilience. It follows with a recommendation to \\n``direct a significant percentage of this spending to environmental \\njustice communities and communities most affected by the economic \\ntransition away from fossil fuel consumption'' (p. 304). This \\nprioritization is necessary and we strongly support this \\nrecommendation.\\n    The Climate Crisis Action Plan includes recommendations of a number \\nof policies that can meet dual goals of reducing pollution and driving \\nlocal economies. One of its building blocks is expanding low-income \\nsolar access and community solar initiatives. The recommendations to \\nachieve this building block include funding and expanding programs to \\nbolster solar access. It also encourages creation of a solar workforce \\nprogram, with a focus on ``individuals who have historically faced \\nbarriers to employment'' (p. 76-77). The Platform and the Climate \\nCrisis Action Plan both identify transportation and goods movements as \\na key sector where strategic investments can reduce air pollution while \\ncreating jobs. The Climate Crisis Action Plan includes recommendations \\nlike investing in zero emissions school buses (p. 118) and transit \\nbuses (p. 119), increasing electrification infrastructure access (p. \\n93, 126), and supporting research and development to drive new \\ntransportation technology (p. 126-127), among others.\\n    In addition to investments informed by communities, as employment \\nopportunities arise from these investments and new policies, the \\nPlatform recommends that workforce and job training programs be \\nprioritized ``especially in communities with disproportionately high \\nunderemployed and unemployed populations and in communities that have \\nbeen historically reliant on fossil field extraction and energy \\nproduction.'' The Climate Crisis Action Plan makes a similar \\nrecommendation. As it says, ``This report makes several recommendations \\nfor new federal investment and incentives for clean and resilient \\ninfrastructure. Congress should direct a significant percentage of this \\nspending to communities most affected by the economic transition away \\nfrom fossil fuel consumption and environmental justice communities. \\nThese communities should receive federal spending and investment first, \\nmost often, and in larger amounts'' (p. 291).\\n    The intersecting crises our nation currently faces are dire--and \\nthe policy solutions to address these crises are interconnected. With \\nmeaningful action to address racial, economic, environmental and \\nclimate justice, Congress can use policy to reduce disparities and \\nbegin to build the just and equitable future envisioned in the Platform \\nand the Climate Crisis Action Plan.\\nNO COMMUNITY WILL BE LEFT BEHIND.\\n    All communities have a right to resources to withstand and cope \\nwith unanticipated natural and man-made threats and to live free from \\nexposure to dangerous toxic pollution. Yet persistent racial and \\neconomic inequalities--and the forces that cause them to have created \\ndisproportionately high public health and environmental risks. Federal \\nclimate policy must address these injustices head-on by developing and \\nimplementing solutions at the scale needed to significantly improve \\ntheir public health and quality of life. We need actions that will end \\nenvironmental racism and the historic concentration of pollution in \\nenvironmental justice communities, and that will rebuild the economy so \\nthat it works for all people and all communities. In meeting the goals \\nand priorities outlined by the Plan, we encourage Congress to support \\nthe following, in line with the Select Committee's Climate Crisis \\nAction Plan\\\\5\\\\:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\5\\\\ https://climatecrisis.house.gov/report\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Invest in equitable and just research and innovation. The EPA's \\nOffice of Research and Development provides the scientific and \\ntechnical foundation to address our nation's environmental and public \\nhealth problems. This environmental research and development \\ninfrastructure must invest and support data collection and tools \\ndevelopment that provides robust, scientific analysis on environmental, \\nhealth and socioeconomic conditions that will assess community burden \\nand vulnerability to pollution.\\n    Invest in equitable and just community collaborative projects. The \\nEPA can enhance its commitment to addressing community priorities and \\nneeds through investment in collaborative projects that will yield \\ninnovation in program development, and data/information collection. \\nEPA's Environmental Justice Small Grants (EJSG) Program provides small \\ngrants to communities to address environmental risks associated with \\nhigh concentrations of pollution, prepare for climate change effects, \\nand improve public health. Significantly expanding this EJSG and \\nsimilar grants programs will support pioneering community-based \\nprojects that can support and catalyze innovation in the federal \\nfamily.\\n    Expand environmental investments in vulnerable communities. \\nSignificant new investment in climate resilient water infrastructure is \\nneeded to address unsafe drinking water and climate-related flooding, \\nsea level rise, and drought. To ensure that vulnerable communities \\nreceive these investments and technologies, it is imperative to engage \\nworkers and firms from vulnerable communities in the design, \\nconstruction, operations and maintenance of these water infrastructure \\nsystems.\\n    Investments in environmental worker training through NIEHS. The \\nInstitute of Environmental Health Science (NIEHS) Environmental Career \\nWorker Training (ECWTP) provides job and safety training to secure jobs \\nin environmental restoration, construction, handling hazardous \\nmaterials and waste, and emergency response. A 2015 report assessing \\nthe program found that ``an annual federal investment of $3.5 million \\nin the ECWTP generates a $100 million return'' due to increased wage-\\nearning potential, tax revenue, and reduced workplace injury and hiring \\ncosts. Increasing this investment to disadvantaged and underrepresented \\nmembers of communities of color and low-income communities will \\ncontribute to reduction in economic and employment inequalities.\\n    Vastly increase funding for the Energy Efficiency and Conservation \\nBlock Grant (EECBG) Program, LIHEAP, and WAP. The EECBG program should \\nprioritize spending in communities left behind by past and ongoing \\nenergy efficiency programs. Expanding LIHEAP and WAP not only prepares \\nus for the new reality of climate change, it can address historic \\ninvestment inequalities.\\n    Mobilize new investment in safe and healthy communities through the \\ncreation of a National Climate Bank. Such investments include clean and \\naffordable energy and transportation options and climate-ready \\ninfrastructure projects. Consistent with the National Climate Bank Act \\nintroduced by Debbie Dingell (D-MI) in December 2019, the National \\nClimate Bank should prioritize investments in economically \\ndisadvantaged areas, tribal communities and communities of color. \\nSpecifically, at least 60 percent of the Bank capital should be \\ninvested in tribal communities, low-income communities and communities \\nof color.\\n\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n\\n    Ms. Castor. Thank you very much.\\n    Mr. Walsh, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Welcome.\\n\\n                    STATEMENT OF JASON WALSH\\n\\n    Mr. Walsh. Thank you, Chair Castor, Ranking Member Graves, \\ndistinguished members of the committee.\\n    My name is Jason Walsh. I am the Executive Director of the \\nBlueGreen Alliance, a national partnership of labor unions and \\nenvironmental organizations. Thank you for the opportunity to \\ntestify today.\\n    We are convening in the midst of a global pandemic. As \\nChair Castor noted, we are approaching 150,000 deaths from \\nCOVID-19 in the U.S., and the 10-week total for unemployment \\nclaims has surpassed 40 million. The pandemic has taken an \\nenormous toll, and it is nowhere close to done.\\n    At the same time, the pandemic has cast a harsh spotlight \\non the parts of our society that already weren't working. We \\nwent into this pandemic with two ongoing and closely related \\ncrises: economic and racial inequality and climate change.\\n    Our nation has been struggling with deep inequality for \\ndecades. As unionization rates have fallen, workers have seen \\ntheir pay shrink and bargaining power eroded. The deck has been \\nstacked even further against people of color, as we are seeing \\nin the context of COVID-19. Black Americans make up 12.5 \\npercent of the U.S. population but represent 22.4 percent of \\nCOVID deaths.\\n    At the same time, we are facing a climate crisis. Climate \\nchange is a dire and urgent threat, and the longer we delay, \\nthe stronger the action required.\\n    We see these issues as fundamentally linked. That is why, \\nthis past summer, we released with our partners ``Solidarity \\nfor Climate Action,'' a concrete platform to address these \\ncrises simultaneously.\\n    We have seen how dangerous the status quo is. We need to \\nmove urgently towards economic recovery, but we know that \\nreturning to normal is not good enough. We have to do better.\\n    As we think about climate change and economic recovery, we \\nbelieve we can accomplish multiple things at the same time. We \\ncan tackle the health and economic crises we are in, invest to \\nprotect and support good jobs that are badly needed, deliver \\npublic health and climate benefits, and create a stronger, \\ncleaner, and more equitable economy for all. We can achieve \\nthis by investing at scale in solutions that deliver climate \\nbenefits while creating and retaining quality jobs and spurring \\neconomic recovery.\\n    This should start with rebuilding America's infrastructure. \\nInvesting now to repair our failing roads and bridges and water \\nsystems, and to modernize our buildings, electric grid, \\ntransportation systems, will boost our economy and create \\nmillions of jobs, while also reducing pollution and combating \\nclimate change.\\n    At the same time, we must reinvest in strengthening and \\ntransforming U.S. manufacturing to build more of the products, \\nmaterials, and technologies of the future here. In line with \\nachieving net-zero emissions economy-wide by 2050, we have the \\nopportunity to modernize and transform our industrial base to \\nmake it the cleanest and most advanced in the world.\\n    This industrial transformation can bring dynamic industries \\nback to communities that have been left behind and secure \\ndomestic supply chains while spurring the creation of a new \\ngeneration of good manufacturing jobs.\\n    We also have to ensure that our investment tackles income \\ninequality and delivers family-sustaining jobs. We have \\nexamples of good union jobs being created in the clean energy \\neconomy: construction workers building wind projects and \\nretrofitting buildings, auto workers making cleaner cars and \\ntrucks. However, not all the new jobs created or promised in \\nthe clean energy economy are high-quality. There are \\ndifferences across sectors when it comes to union density, \\nwages, and benefits. Therefore, in addition to investments in \\ninfrastructure and manufacturing, we need to link those \\ninvestments to strong labor and Buy American standards, and \\nprotect workers' rights to organize across all sectors of the \\neconomy.\\n    Lastly, we must recognize that, even if we are successful \\nin creating and retaining jobs, communities impacted by the \\nongoing energy transition will still be hurt. That is why we \\njoined with partners and allies from coal communities across \\nthe country to develop the ``National Economic Transition \\nPlatform,'' which outlines a policy framework and priorities to \\ninvest in communities and workers hit hard by the decline of \\nthe coal industry.\\n    Working people should not have to suffer economically due \\nto the shift to cleaner, cheaper forms of energy. But a \\ntransition that is fair to workers and communities isn't \\nsomething that will happen organically. It needs to be a \\ndeliberate choice and baked into our climate solutions.\\n    In conclusion, we believe tackling climate change, \\ninequality, and economic recovery can go hand-in-hand and \\nensure that the U.S. emerges from this crisis stronger and more \\nglobally competitive with a cleaner and more equitable economy.\\n    We appreciate the work of this committee and the ambition \\nand breadth and detail of the report produced by committee \\nstaff. We look forward to continuing to work with you moving \\nahead.\\n    Thank you for the opportunity to speak today.\\n    [The statement of Mr. Walsh follows:]\\n\\n                           WRITTEN TESTIMONY\\n\\n                              Jason Walsh\\n\\n                 Executive Director, BlueGreen Alliance\\n\\n               Before the 116th United States Congress, \\n              House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis\\n\\n                      Solving the Climate Crisis: \\n            Building a Vibrant and Just Clean Energy Economy\\n\\n                         Tuesday, July 28, 2020\\n\\n    Thank you Chair Castor, Ranking Member Graves, and distinguished \\nmembers of the committee. My name is Jason Walsh, and I am the \\nExecutive Director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a national partnership of \\nlabor unions and environmental organizations. On behalf of my \\norganization, our partners, and the millions of members and supporters \\nthey represent, I want to thank you for convening this hearing on how \\nwe can build a vibrant and just clean economy while solving the climate \\ncrisis.\\n    The BlueGreen Alliance unites America's largest and most \\ninfluential labor unions and environmental organizations to solve \\ntoday's environmental challenges in ways that create and maintain \\nquality jobs and build a stronger, fairer economy. Our partnership is \\nfirm in its belief that Americans don't have to choose between a good \\njob and a clean environment--we can and must have both.\\n    The world's leading scientific organizations have been unambiguous \\nthat climate change is a dire and urgent threat and that the longer we \\ndelay, the stronger the action required. Over the last decade, we have \\nwitnessed the worsening impacts climate change is having on our \\ncommunities.\\n    At the same time, our nation is struggling with deep and crippling \\neconomic and racial inequality. According to the Economic Policy \\nInstitute, ``the bottom 90% of the American workforce has seen their \\npay shrink radically as a share of total income,'' from 58% in 1979 to \\n47% in 2015.\\\\i\\\\ That is almost $11,000 per household, or $1.35 trillion \\nin additional labor income. There is a direct correlation with the \\ndecrease of worker power over this time, as the share of workers in a \\nunion fell from 24% in 1979 to under 11% now.\\\\ii\\\\\\n    The deck has been stacked even further against people of color. \\nData point after data point illustrates exactly how unequal our economy \\nis. For example, regardless of education level, Black workers are far \\nmore likely to be unemployed than white workers.\\\\iii\\\\ In fact, \\nhistorically, unemployment rates are twice as high for Black workers. \\nThat disparity carries into the workplace as well, with Black workers \\npaid on average 73 cents to the dollar compared to white workers.\\\\iv\\\\ \\nThe wage gap persists regardless of education, and even with advanced \\ndegrees Black workers make far less than white workers at the same \\nlevel. So, it's no surprise that while the poverty rate for white \\nAmericans sits at about 8.1%, for Black households it's 20.7%.\\\\v\\\\\\n    Of course, we are now in the midst of a third devastating and \\ndeadly crisis: the COVID-19 pandemic, which has taken its toll and is \\nnowhere close to done. America has surpassed 4 million cases and \\n140,000 deaths due to the coronavirus.\\\\vi\\\\ The ten-week total for \\nunemployment claims has surpassed 40 million, suggesting about a \\nquarter of our workforce has lost jobs during the pandemic and \\nprojections suggest that even if we start to recover, the unemployment \\nrate will still be around 9.3% by the end of the year.\\\\vii\\\\ And months \\ninto this pandemic, workers continue to struggle to stay safe and \\nhealthy on the job, particularly as states begin to reopen parts of the \\neconomy and state and local government budgets are ravaged, and the \\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration and Mine Safety and \\nHealth Administration under President Trump have refused to do their \\njob and issue enforceable emergency standards for workplace safety.\\n    This pandemic has cast a spotlight on and exacerbated all the parts \\nof our society that already weren't working for the American people. \\nWith unemployment skyrocketing, those still at work being exposed to \\nunacceptable health risks on the job, and families immediately unable \\nto pay rent and mortgages, we're vividly seeing the impact of workers \\nliving paycheck to paycheck and diminished workers' rights on the job. \\nAnd we're seeing clearly how systemic racism has stacked the deck \\nagainst people of color, who, historically and persistently fare worse \\nin our existing economy, having lower wages, less savings to fall back \\non, and significantly higher poverty rates.\\\\viii\\\\ Not only are people \\nof color more economically vulnerable in this crisis, but \\ndisproportionately their lives are being put at greater risk. For \\nexample, Black Americans represent 22.4% of COVID-19 deaths while \\nmaking up just 12.5% of the U.S. population.\\\\ix\\\\ And among those aged \\n45-54, Black and Hispanic/Latino death rates are at least six times \\nhigher than for whites. While whites comprise 62% of people in the U.S. \\nin that age group, 1,013 white people have died from COVID-19 (22% of \\nthe total) compared to 1,448 Black people and 1,698 Hispanic/Latino \\npeople.\\\\x\\\\\\n    We've seen clearly just how dangerous the status quo is. We need to \\nmove urgently towards economic recovery. At the same time, we know that \\nreturning to ``normal'' is not good enough. We have to do better.\\n    Last summer, the BlueGreen Alliance alongside our labor and \\nenvironmental partners released Solidarity for Climate Action a first \\nof its kind platform recognizing that the solutions to economic \\ninequality, racial injustice, and climate change have to be addressed \\nsimultaneously. We have to fight climate change, reduce pollution, and \\ncreate and maintain good-paying, union jobs across the nation all at \\nthe same time. With COVID-19 worsening these crises, the vision of \\nSolidarity for Climate Action is more important now than ever.\\n    We believe our Solidarity for Climate Action Platform and the work \\nof this committee lay out a roadmap to get us there. We can tackle \\nclimate change in a way that achieves multiple goals at the same time--\\nwe can avoid the worst impacts of climate change, deliver public health \\nand environmental benefits to communities, create and maintain good, \\nunions jobs, address economic and racial injustice head on, and create \\na cleaner, stronger, and more equitable economy for all.\\n    How do we do this?\\nInvest in infrastructure and support and retool America's manufacturing \\n        sector\\n    First, we need to invest in common-sense ``win-win'' solutions that \\ndeliver climate benefits while creating and retaining quality jobs and \\nspurring economic recovery.\\n    We cannot address climate change or build a thriving economy with \\nderelict infrastructure. We must move forward with an ambitious plan to \\nrebuild and transform America's infrastructure. Investing now to repair \\nour failing roads and bridges, water systems, and natural gas \\ndistribution pipelines, as well as to modernize our buildings and \\nelectric grid, transform our transportation systems, and support our \\nurban and rural communities, will boost our economy and create millions \\nof jobs, while also reducing pollution and combating climate change--\\npaving the pathway to a strong and equitable recovery.\\n    BlueGreen Alliance research has found that investing an estimated \\n$2.2 trillion in key sectors of America's infrastructure to improve \\nthem from a ``D+'' grade overall to a ``B'' grade has the potential to \\nsupport or create an additional 14.5 million job-years across the U.S. \\neconomy, add a cumulative $1.66 trillion to Gross Domestic Product \\n(GDP) over 10 years, and reduce greenhouse gas pollution and boost \\nclimate resilience--versus a business as-usual approach.\\\\xi\\\\\\n    Making these smart investments will also pay dividends for our \\nenvironment by reducing air and water pollution and tackling the \\nemissions driving climate change. Take transit: supporting transit \\nridership increases commensurate with population growth could save \\nnearly 4.4 billion gallons of fuel and avert the carbon dioxide \\n(CO2) equivalent of 39 million metric tons per year through \\n2025.\\\\xii\\\\ Currently, transit ridership levels save the equivalent \\nenergy of the gasoline used by more than 7.7 million cars a year--\\nnearly as many cars as are registered in Florida, the fourth largest \\nstate.\\\\xiii\\\\ Public transit investments can help reduce harmful \\nemissions, which tend to disproportionately impact communities of color \\nand low-income communities. At the same time, transit systems support \\nthousands of high quality jobs directly and provide essential and daily \\naccess to jobs and opportunity for millions. Expanding and modernizing \\nour transit systems can boost jobs and cut emissions immediately, and \\nbe a key piece of rebuilding clean, livable, equitable, and prosperous \\ncommunities.\\n    And the return on investment we see from infrastructure spending is \\nfar greater than other types of potential policy interventions, like \\ntax cuts for example. Increased federal infrastructure spending has an \\noutput multiplier of 1.57 compared to only 1.03 for an across the board \\ntax cut, 1.01 for a nonrefundable lump-sum tax rebate, and only 0.32 \\nfor cutting the corporate tax rate.\\\\xiv\\\\ The average rate of return \\n(ROR) on infrastructure investment across dozens of studies examined in \\na 2017 report was an impressive 16.7%.\\\\xv\\\\\\n    At the same time, we must reinvest in fortifying and transforming \\nheavy industry and retooling to build more of the products, materials, \\nand technologies of the future here. Manufacturing must be an integral \\npart of any strategy to address the climate emergency. In line with \\nachieving net zero emissions economy-wide by 2050, we have the \\nopportunity to modernize and transform our industrial base to make it \\nthe cleanest and most advanced in the world. This industrial \\ntransformation can bring dynamic industries back to communities that \\nhave been left behind by deindustrialization and under-investment and \\nsecure domestic supply chains while spurring the creation of a new \\ngeneration of good, safe jobs manufacturing clean technology.\\n    This must begin by ensuring that our climate and clean energy goals \\ngo hand in hand with policies to support and create good union jobs in \\nthe clean economy and secure and bring back manufacturing supply \\nchains. And it means ensuring that all public investments are coupled \\nwith high labor standards and robust Buy America/n standards to ensure \\nthat these investments support domestic manufacturing. We can also \\nutilize ``Buy Clean'' and other federal procurement standards that \\nrequire the federal government to consider the carbon footprint of \\ngoods they're purchasing, and to prioritize manufacturing firms that \\nuphold strong labor standards and create good jobs in low-income \\ncommunities.\\n    Establishing robust, high-road, domestic production of clean \\ntechnology can capture the economic benefits of the clean economy in \\nthe United States. Last month, the BlueGreen Alliance released a \\nmanufacturing platform that lays out a national blueprint for how we do \\nthis.\\\\xvi\\\\\\nInvest at the scale this crisis demands, and do it right\\n    This should begin with prioritizing equitable rebuilding and \\ninvestments in those workers and communities that need it most, \\nespecially low-income communities, communities of color, and \\ndeindustrialized communities. Low income communities and communities of \\ncolor are hit the hardest and are less able to deal with the impacts of \\nboth COVID-19 and climate change. For example, these communities are \\nmore likely to be in neighborhoods with more air pollution. A 2019 \\nreport found that Black and Hispanic Americans live in neighborhoods \\nwith more pollution but produce less, whereas white communities are \\nless polluted but white people produce more pollution.\\\\xvii\\\\ The Fourth \\nNational Climate Assessment states that exposure to pollution ``results \\nin adverse respiratory and cardiovascular effects, including premature \\ndeaths, hospital and emergency room visits, aggravated asthma, and \\nshortness of breath,''\\\\xviii\\\\ conditions which in turn increase the \\nrisk of COVID-19 infection.\\n    Generations of economic and racial inequality have \\ndisproportionately exposed communities of color to low wages, toxic \\npollution, and climate threats. We must inject justice into our \\nnation's economy by ensuring that solutions support the hardest hit \\nworkers and communities. We must also ensure that our investments \\ntackle economic inequality and deliver family-sustaining jobs. \\nManufacturing, infrastructure, environmental restoration, and clean \\nenergy are significant drivers of job creation and economic growth, but \\nour investment won't be effective unless we ensure it supports and \\ncreates local jobs with fair wages and benefits and safe working \\nconditions, creates economic opportunity for all people in the \\ncommunities in which they reside, and meets forward-thinking \\nenvironmental standards to ensure resiliency.\\n    We have examples of good jobs being created in the clean energy \\neconomy--whether that is the tradespeople that built the Block Island \\noffshore wind project off the coast of Rhode Island, autoworkers \\nbuilding cleaner cars and trucks, or high-skilled jobs in energy \\nefficiency retrofitting. These are all good, union jobs building a \\nclean energy and climate-resilient economy today.\\n    However, not enough new jobs created or promised in the clean \\nenergy economy are high-quality, family-sustaining jobs. There are \\ndifferences across sectors when it comes to union density, wages, and \\nbenefits. In addition, these new jobs are not always in the same \\ncommunities that have seen the loss of good-paying, union jobs, and if \\nthere are new clean energy projects, they are often less labor \\nintensive.\\n    We can't afford to invest in ways that double down on the crises \\nwe're facing and further exacerbate inequality. We have to ensure that \\nthis investment supports and creates good jobs.\\n    That means a commitment to:\\n     Increase union density across the country through strong \\nsupport of the right to organize throughout the economy--including in \\nthe clean technology sectors;\\n     Apply mandatory labor standards that include prevailing \\nwages, safety and health protections, project labor agreements, \\ncommunity benefit agreements, local hire, and other provisions and \\npractices that prioritize improving training, working conditions, and \\nproject benefits;\\n     Raise labor standards in the non-construction sectors \\nthrough improved wages and benefits and the prioritization of full-time \\nwork that eliminates the misclassification of employees and misuse of \\ntemporary labor;\\n     Invest in training, equipment, preparedness, plan \\ndevelopment, and other tools including through registered \\napprenticeship programs to ensure a robust, skilled, and well-prepared \\nworkforce to address extreme weather events and other impacts caused by \\nclimate change; and\\n     Utilize community benefit, workforce, and other similar \\nagreements that improve access to jobs and career paths, and identify \\nand implement mechanisms to mitigate and improve local economic and \\nenvironmental impacts.\\nEnsure fairness for workers and communities\\n    We must also recognize that even if we are successful in retaining \\njobs while creating new, good jobs, communities impacted by the ongoing \\nenergy transition will still be hurting. Since 2014, U.S. power \\ngenerators retired nearly 62,000 MW of coal-fired generation capacity, \\n13,703 MW, of coal capacity retired in 2019. Another 26,947 MW of \\nretirements are expected through 2025.\\\\xix\\\\ America is already in the \\nmiddle of an energy transition. We need to have a conversation about \\ngetting ahead of this transition, and we need to do this now.\\n    That's why--alongside partners and allies from coal communities \\nacross the country--the BlueGreen Alliance participated in the \\ndevelopment of the National Economic Transition platform.\\\\xx\\\\ The \\nplatform is the product of a year-long collaboration, bringing together \\nlocal, tribal, and labor leaders with public, private, and non-profit \\npartners to develop a policy framework and priorities to invest in \\ncommunities and workers hit hard by the decline of the coal industry. \\nIt calls for ``the creation of an inclusive national transition task \\nforce, tasked to create a national action plan, and the development of \\na new federal Office of Economic Transition, guided by an advisory \\nboard reflective of affected stakeholder groups and communities'' and \\nrecommends these new entities address economic transition through seven \\npillars:\\\\xxi\\\\\\n    1.  Invest in local leaders and long-term economic development \\nplanning. Building the capacity of community-based leaders and \\norganizations provides communities with the resources and incentives to \\nplan early for and respond to coal facility closures. These investments \\nensure communities are prepared for a transition that protects workers \\nand is responsive to local needs.\\n    2.  Expand investments in entrepreneurship and small-businesses in \\nnew sectors to help communities diversify and strengthen their \\neconomies. Investing in small businesses in diverse sectors of the \\neconomy--like health care, renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, \\nand remote work opportunities--grows not just resilience, but stronger, \\nhealthier communities.\\n    3.  Provide bridge support and pathways to quality in-demand, \\nfamily-sustaining jobs for workers. By providing a bridge of support \\nfor workers affected by closures, comprehensive workforce development \\nefforts, and skills training for in-demand jobs, leaders can create a \\npathway to effective and equitable access to high-quality jobs in the \\npublic and private sectors.\\n    4.  Reclaim and remediate coal sites to create jobs while cleaning \\nup the environment. Initiatives to reclaim, remediate, and reuse coal \\nsites and clean up coal ash requires a sizable workforce and \\nimmediately creates jobs for workers while curbing public health and \\nenvironmental risks.\\n    5.  Improve inadequate physical and social infrastructure. \\nInvesting in critical infrastructure, like improved connectivity, \\nstimulates economic development and builds community resiliency. \\nInfrastructure projects create jobs, reduce inequities, and help boost \\ninvestment in healthy, livable communities.\\n    6.  Address the impact of coal company bankruptcies on workers, \\ncommunities, and the environment. Holding companies accountable to \\nfinancial regulations and bankruptcy laws when closing operations helps \\nprotect worker pay and benefits, while also ensuring polluted sites are \\nreclaimed for new development.\\n    7.  Coordinate across programs to ensure communities have access to \\nthe resources they need. Launching an interagency grants program helps \\nensure affected stakeholders have a voice and empowers local \\ncommunities with federal resources.\\n    The state of Colorado has advanced legislation that provides a \\nmodel for achieving these goals. It passed landmark legislation, House \\nBill 1314, during the 2019 state legislative session. The legislation, \\nwhich was envisioned and championed by the BlueGreen Alliance and our \\npartners, created the first State Office of Just Transition, and \\nmandated creation of a statewide Just Transition plan for coal workers \\nand communities. A 19-member advisory board will present their draft \\nplan on August 1st along with staff of the new office, partners like \\nthe BlueGreen Alliance, and state agencies.\\n    The Colorado Just Transition plan recommends structural \\nimprovements to how the state supports rural communities where coal \\nmining or power plants are likely to close. Key to Colorado's plan will \\nbe developing worker support programs that assist impacted workers in \\ntransition to new work. The plan will also recommend state policies \\nthat reduce the impact of tax loss on communities, enhance economic \\ndevelopment, develop entrepreneurial talent, dedicate capital to \\nimprove community infrastructure and ensure coal site cleanup, and \\nsecure financing for expanding businesses in coal transition \\ncommunities. Several states are watching Colorado's implementation of \\nHouse Bill 1314, and considering similar initiatives.\\n    Any plan advanced by forward-looking states will have to be \\nsupported and supplemented by additional Federal resources. Federal \\nfunding, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic stretches already thin \\nstate and local budgets, will be vital to giving coal communities the \\nresources and tools they need to diversify their economies and support \\ntheir workers through transition.\\n    Working people should not have to suffer economically due to the \\nshift to cleaner, cheaper forms of energy, but a transition that is \\nfair for workers and communities isn't something that will happen \\norganically. Prioritizing workers and fossil fuel-impacted communities \\nneeds to be a deliberate choice. A fair and equitable transition and \\nthe creation of good-paying, union jobs need to be baked into our \\nsolutions on climate change.\\nRebuild the public sector and provide long term support and protections \\n        for workers to ensure we are prepared for crises\\n    Lastly, we need to rebuild the capacity of the public sector, the \\nhealth care system, public health agencies, education, and community-\\nbased services to prepare for and respond to disasters like COVID-19 \\ntoday, and to keep our communities safe and stable for the future. \\nWorkers and communities cannot deal with crises alone, whether they are \\nglobal pandemics or extreme weather events caused by climate change. We \\nalso must rebuild and expand the social safety net--including pensions, \\nhealthcare, and retirement security--and ensure and enforce worker and \\ncommunity health and safety.\\nConclusion\\n    The solutions to the crises we're facing--climate change, and \\neconomic and racial inequality--are as interconnected as their causes \\nand we are happy to see that many of those solutions are included in \\nthe staff report released by the House Select Committee on the Climate \\nCrisis. The report is far-reaching and we look forward to working with \\nyou on a climate plan that launches an economic recovery that provides \\nsolutions to create a stronger, cleaner, and more equitable economy \\nthat works for all Americans.\\n    Thank you again for the opportunity to speak today.\\n\\n    i Environmental Policy Institute (EPI), ``What labor \\nmarket changes have generated inequality and wage suppression?'' \\nDecember 12, 2019.

Thank you, Mr. Walsh.\\n    Mr. Shellenberger, you are recognized for 5 minutes.\\n\\n               STATEMENT OF MICHAEL SHELLENBERGER\\n\\n    Mr. Shellenberger. Thank you, Chairperson Castor, Ranking \\nMember Graves, and members of the committee.\\n    During the first decade of this century, I advocated a very \\nsimilar suite of policies on renewables, transmission lines, \\nenergy efficiency, mass trans, electric vehicles that are \\ncurrently being proposed by the Democrats' proposed climate \\nplan, and they failed to create the new manufacturing capacity, \\nthe radical decarbonization, the good jobs with high pay, or \\nhigher economic growth.\\n    A former Obama Administration economist at the University \\nof Chicago found last year that consumers in states with \\nrenewable-energy mandates paid $125 billion more for \\nelectricity in the 7 years after their passage than they would \\nhave otherwise.\\n    Renewables contributed to electricity prices rising six \\ntimes more in California than in the rest of the United States \\nsince 2011. And we have seen renewables have that same impact \\naround the world. They caused electricity prices to rise 50 \\npercent in Germany since 2007.\\n    And the problem underlying it all is physics. Solar and \\nwind make electricity expensive because they are unreliable, \\nthey require 100-percent backup, and they are energy-dilute, \\nrequiring extensive land, transmission lines, and mining.\\n    Opposition to wind and solar projects has grown so much \\nthat even renewable energy advocates today admit that the \\nenvironmental impact of renewables is the greatest obstacle to \\ntheir deployment. Solar and wind farms around the world \\nrequire, on average, 300 to 400 times more land than a natural \\ngas or a nuclear plant to provide the same quantity of energy, \\nalbeit unreliably.\\n    The renewable energy industry claims technical innovations \\nwill improve solar and wind, but nothing can change the low \\npower density of sunlight and wind. Even a 10-percent \\nimprovement in the efficiency of solar panels would only reduce \\nthe staggering amount of land required to produce the same \\namount of energy, from 400 times more to 360 times more.\\n    The dilute nature of sunlight and wind means that solar and \\nwind projects require large amounts of land that come within \\nsignificant environmental impacts. The respected energy scholar \\nVaclav Smil estimates that achieving 100 percent renewables \\nwould require dedicating 25 to 50 percent of all the land in \\nthe United States to energy production, up from a half a \\npercent. Vaclav Smil, by the way, is referred to by Bill Gates \\nas the person whose books he most looks forward to reading.\\n    So this raises significant environmental justice concerns. \\nIt is notable that the advocacy for industrial wind comes from \\nmostly affluent people who live on the coasts, not near wind \\nturbines. Communities most able to resist industrial wind \\nprojects, such as people on Cape Cod or people in places like \\nMarin County of California or northern California, are able to \\nresist wind energy projects and seek to place them in poorer \\ncommunities in the Midwest.\\n    A report released earlier this month documented 200 cases \\nof renewable energy companies and their proxies violating human \\nrights around the world, including through murder, dangerous \\nworking conditions, and theft.\\n    And yet, in the plan, House Democrats propose as a high \\npriority the creation of a super grid consisting of \\ntransmission lines like the one proposed for the largely \\npristine Sandhills of Nebraska, which would have a 3.5-mile \\nbuffer and cross 600 individual wetlands. It is notable that \\nthe single greatest threat to whooping cranes is considered \\ntransmission lines, and the leading opponent of that project is \\nfrom the Oglala Sioux Tribe.\\n    I think we have misdescribed climate change as a crisis or \\nan emergency. I say this as an environmental activist for 30 \\nyears, as a climate activist for 20 years. No credible \\nscientific body has ever claimed that climate change threatens \\nthe collapse of civilization, much less the extinction of the \\nhuman species.\\n    There is a lot of good news we should pay attention to here \\nand build upon. Deaths from natural disasters have declined 90 \\npercent over 100 years. We produce 25 percent more food than we \\nconsume today, and most experts believe that, as we continue to \\nexpand fertilizer, irrigation, and modern agriculture to poor \\ncountries, those food surpluses will rise.\\n    All else being equal, it would be best to have no change to \\nglobal temperature, but, obviously, not all else is equal. \\nThose big gains in resilience are a consequence of the \\navailability of cheap energy.\\n    So the good news is that carbon emissions have been \\ndeclining in the United States for a decade and a half. They \\npeaked in Britain, France, and Germany in the mid-1970s. \\nEconomic growth brings significant reductions of carbon \\nemissions. I would question why, if we think that solar and \\nwind are so cheap, they would require $2 trillion in subsidies \\nto be scaled up.\\n    I think a more significant challenge for this committee to \\nconsider is the decline of nuclear energy. Only nuclear has \\nproven capable of replacing fossil fuels on a one-to-one basis, \\nand yet the American nuclear industry is in decline. And while \\nthere are some interesting initiatives aimed at reviving it, we \\ndo not have a national nuclear strategy to compete with the \\nRussians and Chinese.\\n    Every time a nation does a nuclear power project, it is an \\nextension of soft power. They are basically going into the \\nsphere of influence of that country. And as we have all kind of \\nwitnessed in horror how the Chinese Government is engaged in a \\ngenocide against its ethnic Muslim minority, I think the United \\nStates needs to step up its game and be competitive with the \\nRussians and Chinese in building new power plants abroad. And \\nthat is going to require building more nuclear power plants at \\nhome.\\n    So I will just end by urging the committee to consider the \\nneed for a green nuclear deal so that we can achieve both \\nenvironmental, climate, and also our national security \\nobjectives at the same time.\\n    Thank you very much.\\n    [The statement of Mr. Shellenberger follows:]\\n\\n                 Testimony of Michael D.

The \\ncause of climate change is energy consumption, and energy consumption \\nhas been a critical part of rising resilience to disasters, greater \\nfood production, and the protection of the natural environment. As \\nsuch, there has long been a debate over how much more we should pay for \\nenergy to reduce climate change.\\n    The good news is that recent and historical events show that \\neconomic growth can actually lower carbon emissions. Carbon emissions \\nhave been declining in the US for nearly a decade and a half thanks to \\nthe cheap natural gas, which made electricity cheaper than it otherwise \\nwould have been. In fact, experts have long recognized that while the \\nearly stages of a nation's industrialization can increase air \\npollution, later stages can lower it through cleaner-burning coal, \\nnatural gas, and nuclear energy. Those technologies and others allowed \\nconventional air pollutants to peak in developed nations the 1960s and \\n1970s.

When the US and Soviet Union nearly went \\nto nuclear war over Cuba; when there was nearly a run on the banks in \\n2008; when the coronavirus forced radical action to prevent millions of \\ndeaths earlier this year; each of those events, I believe, can be \\nfairly described as crisis, a time of intense danger, or an emergency, \\nwhich is not just serious but also unexpected. Climate change is real \\nand we should continue reducing emissions through the use of natural \\ngas and nuclear. But it is neither a crisis nor an emergency.\\n    Nor is climate change one of our most important environmental \\nproblems. The continued use of wood as fuel by two billion people; air \\npollution that shortens the lives of roughly seven million people per \\nyear; the decline of wild animal populations; and the loss of habitat \\nfor endangered species, are all more important and urgent environmental \\nproblems than climate change.\\n    I fear climate change has become a distraction from far more \\nsignificant problems including the hollowing out of the middle-class by \\nglobalization and automation; our overdependence on China for \\npharmaceuticals, medical supplies, drones, and other manufactured \\nproducts; the lack of sufficient housing in our major coastal cities; \\nthe intertwined drug addiction and mental health crises which increased \\nannual overdose deaths from 17,000 to 70,000 since 2000; the extreme \\npolitical polarization tearing our nation apart; and the active \\ndestruction of the US nuclear industry.\\n     iii. why nuclear energy is more important than climate change\\n    Anyone genuinely concerned about climate change, air pollution, or \\nthe impact of renewables on wildlife should advocate nuclear energy. \\nOnly nuclear can substitute for fossil fuels while maintaining and \\nincreasing levels of energy consumption required for universal human \\nprosperity. Nuclear-heavy French electricity produces one-tenth the \\ncarbon emissions as renewables-heavy German electricity at nearly half \\nthe price. Nuclear is not only the safest way to make electricity, it \\nhas actually saved two million lives, according to the best available \\nresearch.

In \\n1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower gave his famous ``atoms for \\npeace'' speech at the United Nations where he pledged that the US would \\nhelp nations use nuclear energy to lift themselves out of poverty. \\nToday, nine out of every ten gigawatts of global nuclear capacity today \\nis descended from designs invented and commercialized by the United \\nStates. American nuclear reactor designs today operate in leading \\nnuclear countries like China, France, South Korea, Japan, and the \\nUnited Kingdom. American reactors operated in the US are the best in \\nthe world, operating 93 percent of the time.\\n    Because of the inherently dual military-civilian nature of nuclear \\nenergy, Congress and most presidential administrations have long viewed \\nAmerica's nuclear power plants, and our involvement in the nuclear \\nenergy programs of other nations, as top national security priorities. \\nThanks to American leadership, nuclear energy has proven to be the \\nsafest and cleanest way to make electricity. And, for 75 years, nuclear \\nenergy has been used solely for peaceful purposes.\\n    But now, the US is building just one nuclear plant at home and none \\nabroad, allowing China and Russia to dominate the market for nuclear \\npower plant construction. Nations seeking nuclear energy today include \\nArgentina, Bangladesh, Belarus, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, the Czech \\nRepublic, Egypt, Finland, Ghana, Hungary, India, Jordan, Kazakhstan, \\nKenya, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, South \\nAfrica, Sudan, Turkey, the UAE, the UK, Uzbekistan, and Zambia, among \\nothers.\\n    In the seven months that have passed since the last time I \\ntestified before Congress, China has stepped up its genocide of its \\nMuslim minority and Russia has modified its constitution to allow its \\npresident to serve for decades longer. I greatly admire the Russian and \\nChinese nuclear energy programs, and indeed believe they represent the \\nstandard against which the US must compete. But their rejection of \\nliberal democracy and human rights are profoundly troubling for the \\nfuture of nuclear energy and the world.\\n    Nations that decide to work with China and Russia rather than the \\nUnited States or other liberal Western democracy will effectively \\nbecome part of their sphere of influence. Nuclear power plants are \\nenormous construction projects, and thus marry large construction \\nfirms, financial institutions, and governments, in the way that only \\nlarge projects can do.\\n    But beyond those economic ties are national security ones. The line \\nbetween soft power and hard power runs through nuclear energy. The \\ncreation of a scientific and technical workforce capable of creating \\nnuclear energy brings nations closer to being able to one day create \\nnuclear weapons. It is thus logical that nations gain a national \\nsecurity benefit simply from having nuclear plants.\\\\33\\\\ If nations are \\nin partnership with Russia or China in building nuclear plants, they \\ncould one day be in partnership with those countries in other ways.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\33\\\\ Matthew Fuhrmann et al, ``Almost Nuclear: Introducing the \\nNuclear Latency Dataset,'' Conflict Management and Peace Science, \\nJanuary 8, 2015.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    For the US to compete in building nuclear plants abroad we must \\nbuild them at home. While the nuclear industry deserves great credit \\nfor the continuous improvement of power plant safety and efficiency, \\nmany utility executives are either resigned to the technology's decline \\nor engaged in wishful thinking about inventing new families of reactor \\ntechnology.\\n    The reason nations and utilities opt for large light-water reactors \\nis because they produce the cheapest electricity. What makes nuclear \\ncheaper are larger reactors, since they do not require correspondingly \\nlarger workforces, and extensive experience building and operating \\nthem. But even if nations were to eventually opt for smaller reactors, \\nthey would likely purchase them from the nations that offer the most \\nfavorable financial terms while having the most experience building \\nreactors, which today are China and Russia.\\n    If the US were to decide to compete with China and Russia, it \\nshould consider deepening partnerships with other members of the \\nWestern Alliance, and ending imports of uranium from Russia. It might \\nhave made sense 20 years ago for the US to ensure the stability of the \\nRussian nuclear industry through purchases of its uranium. But with \\nRussia out-competing the US on new nuclear plant construction, and \\nengaging in cyber attacks on our electrical grid, it is not clear how \\nit any longer makes sense for the U.S. to import uranium from Russia. I \\nthus applaud steps by the Department of Energy to end reliance on \\nimported Russian uranium.\\\\34\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\34\\\\ John Funk, ``DOE targets end to US reliance on Russian nuclear \\nfuel, revived domestic capability,'' Utility Dive, July 20, 2020.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Given all of that, I would like to pose three questions. First, is \\nit in the interest of American taxpayers to subsidize US electric \\nutilities to operate nuclear plants in the absence of any commitment to \\nbuild new ones? Second, does Congress believe the US can compete with \\nChina and Russia while shutting down half to two-thirds of its nuclear \\nplants? Third, is Congress really comfortable standing by and watching \\ndozens of nations partner with China and Russia to expand their use of \\nnuclear technology over the next century?\\n    If the answer to the latter question is yes, Congress should inform \\nthe American people that it has decided to cede America's historic role \\nas creator, promotor, and steward of the world's most sensitive dual-\\nuse technology to our main geopolitical rivals.\\n    In the face of nuclear energy's leadership vacuum in the U.S., I \\nurge Congress to consider creating a Green Nuclear Deal as a revision \\nto the Atomic Energy Act that would restore America's nuclear \\nleadership at a global level. The goal should be nuclear energy \\ndominance. The U.S. government should encourage the building of large, \\nstandardized nuclear plants at home, and export its natural gas abroad. \\nDoing this would require identifying a national champion company to \\ncompete with the state-owned companies of Russia and China, and the \\npresident working to sell U.S. nuclear plants abroad, just as the \\nleaders of China and Russia do.\\n    In the 1950s, members of Congress who understood the sensitive and \\nspecial nature of the technology urged the White House to make \\nAmerica's dominance of nuclear energy a top national security priority. \\nI hope all of you would consider doing so again today.\\n    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify. I look forward to \\nyour questions.\\n\\n    Ms. Castor. Ms. Soholt, you are recognized for 5 minutes.\\n\\n                    STATEMENT OF BETH SOHOLT\\n\\n    Ms. Soholt. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman Castor, Ranking \\nMember Graves, and distinguished committee members.\\n    My name is Beth Soholt, and I am the Executive Director of \\nthe Clean Grid Alliance. I am here today to offer some thoughts \\nfrom America's heartland, the renewable-energy stronghold of \\nthe country, where we are seeing renewable energy deployed \\ncost-effectively and reliably.\\n    I am here testifying today in support of the Macro Grid \\nInitiative. MGI is a national effort led by the American \\nCouncil on Renewable Energy and Americans for a Clean Energy \\nGrid, in partnership with organizations including the American \\nWind Energy Association and the Solar Energy Industries \\nAssociation.\\n    The Macro Grid Initiative advocates expanding and upgrading \\nthe nation's transmission network to deliver job growth and \\neconomic development, a cleaner environment, and lower cost for \\nconsumers.\\n    The pursuit of a macro grid, an interregionally connected \\nbackbone for the nation's transmission grid, is essential for \\nthe United States to achieve its climate goals and charge up \\nthe economy.\\n    Over the last 20 years, I have seen firsthand the multiple \\nbenefits new grid infrastructure brings to a region. \\nCommunities that host renewable projects receive new and needed \\nrevenue; engineers, electricians, and local labor folks are put \\nto work in good-paying jobs; customers get clean, affordable \\npower; and electric utilities get investment opportunities.\\n    So let's talk about the Macro Grid. The Macro Grid vision \\nincludes expanding the interregional high-voltage transmission \\nsystem, tightening up the seams that exist between the various \\ntransmission operators, and adding a network of high-voltage \\ndirect current lines that could deliver significant carbon \\nreduction.\\n    A Macro Grid enables carbon emissions reductions of nearly \\n80 percent while saving consumers up to $47 billion annually \\nand returning more than $2.50 for every dollar invested.\\n    Most importantly, the Macro Grid vision builds upon the \\nsuccess that we have seen expanding and updating the grid in \\ncertain regions of the country. But the Macro Grid vision will \\nrequire a modernized policy and regulatory environment to \\nrecognize the substantial nationwide benefits of new regional \\nand interregional transmission.\\n    So what are the benefits to expanding the high-voltage \\ntransmission system?\\n    First, job creation. Constructing transmission lines brings \\na lot of good-paying jobs. Transmission is generally built \\nusing organized labor, project labor agreements, and prevailing \\nwage standards. I have an example in my testimony of the jobs, \\nboth direct, indirect, and induced, that would be created from \\na substantial build-out of 100 gigawatts' worth of \\ntransmission. But these jobs are in addition to the jobs that \\nare created from wind and solar project development, \\nmanufacturing wind turbines and component parts, and supply \\nchain jobs.\\n    Second, economic growth and development. Constructing new \\ntransmission lines provides an economic engine for the nation's \\neconomy. There is an example of Midwest utilities working \\ntogether through the CapX2020 initiative. The major build-out \\nof 5 new transmission lines, 800 miles of new transmission, was \\na $2 billion project that resulted in $4 billion worth of \\neconomic impact in the region, $150 million paid in State and \\nFederal taxes, 8,000 jobs at the peak of construction, and \\nreturned $1.93 worth of benefit to electric utility customers \\nfor every dollar invested. So, you see, developing transmission \\nis truly an economic engine that drives business here in the \\nUnited States.\\n    Finally, I want to talk about competitiveness. Mr. \\nShellenberger mentioned China and other countries. In the \\nUnited States, and around the world, manufacturers and energy-\\nintensive technology industries, such as data centers, can \\nlocate their operations anywhere. What they are asking for is \\nlow-cost, carbon free electricity. A number of utilities have \\nput in place ambitious carbon reduction goals. Renewable energy \\nwith transmission enables the demands of these corporate energy \\nusers and utilities to be met.\\n    In addition, the U.S. is competing globally with countries \\nlike China. China has recently jumped past the American grid \\nbuild-out success with their own much higher voltage DC \\nsuperhighway.\\n    And so, as the committee and your colleagues craft \\nlegislation, I urge you to make electric grid infrastructure \\npolicies a bipartisan priority.\\n    I commend the Select Committee's majority report for its \\nrecommendations to create a national policy on transmission, \\nencourage FERC to develop an infrastructure strategy, improve \\ntransmission planning, and remove barriers to transmission \\npermitting.\\n    As I have seen firsthand in my work in the Midwest, \\ntransmission enables electric utilities, businesses, customers, \\nworkers, communities, and the environment to not only survive \\nbut thrive. Most importantly, building a Macro Grid can help \\nthe nation address the climate crisis and bring the multiple \\nbenefits I have outlined in my testimony.\\n    Thank you, and I look forward to questions.\\n    [The statement of Ms. Soholt follows:]\\n\\n              A Macro Grid Vision to Achieve the Nation's \\n              Climate Goals and ``Charge Up'' the Economy\\n\\n       Beth Soholt, Executive Director, Clean Grid Alliance (CGA)\\n\\n          For CGA, the American Council on Renewable Energy, \\n                 and Americans for a Clean Energy Grid\\n\\n     Testimony to the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis\\n\\n                             July 28, 2020\\n\\n    Good afternoon and thank you for the opportunity to testify on this \\nextremely important topic. I am honored to appear before the Select \\nCommittee to bring thoughts and ideas from the Midwest--America's \\nrenewable energy heartland.\\n    My name is Beth Soholt. I'm the Executive Director of the Clean \\nGrid Alliance, and I am testifying today in support of the Macro Grid \\nInitiative (MGI), a national effort led by the American Council on \\nRenewable Energy and Americans for a Clean Energy Grid committed to \\nexpanding and upgrading the nation's transmission network to deliver \\njob growth and economic development, a cleaner environment, and lower \\ncosts for consumers.\\n    The pursuit and achievement of a Macro Grid--an interregionally \\nconnected backbone for the nation's transmission grid--is essential for \\nthe United States to achieve its climate goals and ``charge up'' the \\neconomy. A Macro Grid can deliver renewable energy from the resource to \\nload, enhance grid resiliency, and dramatically reduce carbon emissions \\nby spurring a large amount of renewable energy development.\\n    Over the last 20 years, I have seen firsthand the multiple benefits \\nnew grid infrastructure--like high voltage transmission lines--brings \\nto a region rich in renewable energy resources. Communities that host \\nwind and solar farms receive new and needed revenue in their counties \\nand townships; engineers, electricians, and local labor folks are put \\nto work in good-paying jobs; customers get clean, affordable power in \\ntheir homes, businesses, farms and factories; and electric utility \\ncompanies have infrastructure investment opportunities and a variety of \\nrenewable energy projects to choose from.\\n    I will cover three points in my testimony and take them in order:\\n    1.  The Macro Grid vision\\n    2.  Benefits of an expanded, upgraded transmission system\\n    3.  How Congress can advance policies for grid infrastructure to \\nmeet climate goals and stimulate the economy\\n    First, the Macro Grid vision.\\\\1\\\\ The Macro Grid endeavors to take \\nadvantage of the vast renewable energy resources across the country and \\ndeliver the clean energy to locations where it is needed.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ https://acore.org/macro-grid-initiative/\\n?mc_cid=f0936965a0&mc_eid=%5BUNIQID%5D\\n\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n    The Macro Grid vision includes expanding interregional high voltage \\ntransmission, tightening up the ``seams'' that exist between the \\nvarious transmission operators, and adding a network of High Voltage \\nDirect Current (HVDC) lines that could deliver significant carbon \\nemissions reductions.

We urge the Select Committee to make \\nachieving the Macro Grid vision a priority as you craft climate change \\nand stimulus legislation.\\n    Second, what are the benefits to expanding the high voltage \\ntransmission system? In addition to spurring robust renewable energy \\ndevelopment that would yield significant carbon reductions, there are \\nmajor economic benefits to grid expansion.\\n         Job Creation--Constructing transmission lines creates a lot of \\ngood paying jobs. Transmission is generally built using organized \\nlabor, Project Labor Agreements and prevailing wage standards. As an \\nexample, to build 100 GW worth of transmission delivery capacity, about \\n$75 billion in transmission infrastructure would be needed. That would \\ncreate around 600,000 direct jobs and 1.5 million direct, indirect and \\ninduced jobs.\\\\9\\\\ These jobs are in addition to jobs created from wind \\nand solar project development, manufacturing wind turbines and \\ncomponent parts, and supply chain for wind and solar projects.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\9\\\\ https://gridstrategiesllc.com/2020/07/27/transmission-and-jobs/\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n         Economic Growth and Development--Constructing new transmission \\nlines provides an economic engine for the nation's economy. For \\nexample, the 11 Midwestern electric utilities that were part of the \\nCapX2020 \\\\10\\\\ initiative built 5 major 345kV transmission lines located \\nin North and South Dakota, Minnesota, and Wisconsin with the last line \\njust finished a few years ago. Altogether, the 800 miles of new \\ntransmission was a $2 billion project that resulted in $4 billion of \\neconomic impact in the region, $150 million paid in state and federal \\ntaxes, 8,000 jobs at the peak of construction, and returned $1.93 worth \\nof benefit to electric utility customers for every dollar invested.\\\\11\\\\ \\nDeveloping transmission is truly an economic engine that drives \\nbusiness here in the United States.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\10\\\\ http://www.capx2020.com/\\n    \\\\11\\\\ http://www.capx2020.com/Gallery/movies/economic-benefits.html\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n         Competitiveness--Manufacturers and energy-intensive technology \\nindustries such as data centers can locate their operations anywhere in \\nthe world. The technology firms have been telling utilities and \\npolicymakers across the Midwest that they want a low-cost, carbon-free \\nelectricity supply. Responding to their customers and state policy, a \\nnumber of utilities have put in place ambitious 80 to 100 percent de-\\ncarbonization goals. Renewable energy with transmission enables the \\ndemands of these corporate energy users and utilities to be met. In \\naddition, the U.S. is competing globally with countries who have also \\nfigured out that building big infrastructure to tap domestic resources \\nis a path to economic growth and security. China, for example, recently \\njumped past the American grid buildout successes with their own much \\nhigher voltage DC superhighways connecting their resource areas to \\nmajor population centers.\\n    Finally, as this Committee and your colleagues discuss and debate \\nupcoming legislation, I urge you to make electric grid infrastructure \\npolicies a bipartisan priority. In that regard, I commend the Select \\nCommittee Majority Report for its recommendations to create a national \\npolicy on transmission and an ``American Supergrid,'' encourage FERC to \\ndevelop an infrastructure strategy and improve regional and \\ninterregional planning, remove barriers to transmission development in \\nthe current state-by-state permitting regime, support federal financial \\nresources to help right-size lines for the long term, and provide DOE \\nfunding and technical assistance for transmission planning.\\n    As I've seen firsthand in my work in the Midwest, transmission \\nenables electric utilities, businesses, manufacturers, residential \\ncustomers, workers, rural and urban communities and the environment to \\nnot only survive but thrive. Most importantly, building a Macro Grid \\ncan help the nation address the climate crisis AND bring the multiple \\nbenefits I've outlined in my testimony.\\n    Thank you and I look forward to answering any questions you may \\nhave.\\n\\n    Ms. Castor. As a reminder to all of the members and to \\nwitnesses, please keep your video cameras on. If your camera is \\nnot on at the time we come to you, we will have to skip over \\nyou in the order of questions.\\n    So I will recognize myself for 5 minutes.\\n    I think American families and businesses are eager to move \\nto the clean energy economy. And the ``Solving the Climate \\nCrisis'' majority staff report calls for achieving a net-zero \\nelectricity grid by no later than 2040. To achieve that, we are \\ngoing to need to rapidly deploy more renewables. We are going \\nto have to modernize the grid and expand transmission capacity \\nto get more renewables to the market. Fortunately, as Ms. \\nSoholt testified, transmission construction creates a lot of \\ngood-paying, union jobs.\\n    Ms. Soholt, why is a Macro Grid, as you call it, a better \\napproach for renewables and clean-energy deployment than the \\nway we move electricity now?\\n    Ms. Soholt. Thank you, Chairwoman Castor, for the first \\nquestion.\\n    We have a lot of work to do to modernize our electricity \\ngrid. And so achieving the Macro Grid vision will not only \\nenable the benefits that I talked about, but it really enables \\nthe good resources to be able to get to the load. It is as \\nsimple as that. We need to connect the high wind and solar \\nresource areas to the large load centers that need the power.\\n    And so we have reform of the way we go about paying for, \\nplanning, permitting infrastructure to be able to achieve the \\ntimeframes that the committee report talks about. So 2040 is an \\naggressive goal, given that there is so much work to be done. \\nAnd so the Macro Grid provides a vision and the implementation \\nof achieving that vision.\\n    Ms. Castor. And, Mr. Walsh, what is going to be key to \\nhaving the workers to build this Macro Grid?\\n    I know in your testimony you state, we must reinvest in \\nfortifying and transforming heavy industry and retooling to \\nbuild more of the products, materials, and technologies of the \\nfuture here and that manufacturing must be an integral part of \\nany strategy.\\n    So why is that? Talk to us about what you see in the Macro \\nGrid, the types of jobs that will be available, and what else \\nin innovative, clean technologies for American workers.\\n    Mr. Walsh. Thank you, Chair Castor, for the question.\\n    I mean, first, let's start by just recognizing the \\nindustrial sector represents a pretty significant source of \\nU.S. emissions. And, actually, if you distribute electricity to \\nits economic end use, the industrial sector is the largest \\nsource of emissions in the United States. And it is also the \\nfastest growing over time, both domestically and globally. So, \\nfrom a climate perspective, we have to focus on how we reduce \\nemissions from this sector.\\n    At the same time, these industries are essential to produce \\nthe materials and components for the Macro Grid and other \\ntechnologies for our infrastructure, and they are absolutely \\nessential for producing the goods that constitute modern life. \\nThey are enormously important economically. Manufacturing \\ndirectly employs about 1 in 11 American workers, and \\ncontributes $2 trillion a year to the gross domestic product.\\n    This is also an issue of global economic competitiveness, \\nas you have touched on. Global investments in clean energy, \\ntransportation infrastructure technologies, are forecast to \\nreach into the tens of trillions of dollars over the next three \\ndecades, representing both a powerful opportunity for job \\ncreation and economic growth. It is also a serious risk if \\nAmerican workers and companies get left behind.\\n    So the bottom line, from our perspective, is, prioritizing \\ninvestments in U.S. manufacturing will not only reduce \\ngreenhouse-gas emissions, but it will also create and retain \\ngood jobs, for two primary reasons.\\n    One, a significant proportion of emission reductions can be \\nrealized simply by reducing energy waste, which saves money \\nthat manufacturers can otherwise use for workforce and capital \\ninvestments and which also supports jobs through the \\ninstallation of energy efficiency technologies.\\n    And, second, the U.S. manufacturers' ability to produce \\nclean technologies and to use cleaner products and processes \\nwill make them more competitive in a global economy in which \\nmarket demand is shifting inexorably in that direction.\\n    And it is our sense that if we manufacture clean products \\nand manufacture all products cleaner, we position U.S. \\nmanufacturers to be in the pole position for the most important \\neconomic development race globally over the next few decades.\\n    I will make one more point, which is that, when we reduce \\nthe industrial sector greenhouse-gas emissions, we can also \\nreduce other sources of pollution that disproportionately \\nimpact fenceline communities. So a clean manufacturing agenda \\nwill also directly combat environmental injustice.\\n    Ms. Castor. Thank you, Mr. Walsh.\\n    Next, Ranking Member Graves, you are recognized for 5 \\nminutes.\\n    Mr. Graves. Thank you, Madam Chair.\\n    I appreciate all of your testimony and consider it helpful.\\n    Mr. Shellenberger, you, I believe, are in California. The \\nmodel that the committee report is based upon largely appears \\nto be the California model.\\n    I mentioned in my opening statement that the State of \\nCalifornia, I believe, is the 44th greatest emissions-reducing \\nstate, or near the bottom. And yet I know, for example, the gas \\nprices are 52 percent higher this month in California than they \\nare in Louisiana. I know that their electricity costs are more \\nthan double the cost that we pay in my home state. And, for the \\nrecord, I think I paid $1.52 a gallon when I gassed up a few \\nweeks ago, and so very, very low gas prices.\\n    If you were in charge, you are a dictator, you are in \\ncharge of putting forth, proffering an energy strategy, an \\nemissions reduction strategy, what do you think is missing or \\nhow would you do things differently based upon more science and \\nyour experience with different technologies, again, if you were \\nin charge, with an energy policy that achieved emissions \\nreductions?\\n    Mr. Shellenberger. Yeah, I live in California, and our \\nelectricity prices rose six times more than in the rest of the \\nUnited States since 2011 because of the expansion of renewables \\nand transmission lines. Between 2011 and 2018, our industrial \\nelectricity prices rose 32 percent.\\n    So I share Mr. Walsh's view that America needs a new \\nindustrial capacity, but we are not going to be able to compete \\nwith China or our rival with expensive energy. And as a \\nreminder, that is what killed cap and trade in 2010 in the \\nSenate, was concern from Midwest Democrats that higher \\nelectricity prices would undermine global competitiveness. Of \\ncourse it would.\\n    California is not even a leader on climate change. Our \\ncarbon emissions rose 3.5 percent between 2011 and 2016 even as \\nthey declined 5 percent in the rest of the United States. So \\nthe pure reason is because we are doing what Germany has done. \\nWe are shutting down our nuclear plants, scaling up renewables.\\n    If you want just two real world comparisons, Germany spends \\nalmost----\\n    Mr. Graves. I can't see the time.\\n    Mr. Shellenberger [continuing]. As much for electricity as \\nFrance, and its electricity is 10 times more carbon-intensive.\\n    So, I mean, this is not that complicated. If you want to \\nreplace fossil fuels, you need to replace them with a reliable \\nsource of electricity. The only scalable form of zero-carbon \\nelectricity is nuclear power, and it is being killed off mostly \\nin Democratic States. They are just shutting down Indian Point \\nin New York--a perfectly fine, safe, wonderful nuclear plant in \\nNew York. We are shutting down Diablo Canyon in California.\\n    I appreciate the efforts to do R&D on nuclear, but the \\nChinese and Russians are selling nuclear to literally two or \\nthree dozen countries around the world. Every country that \\nworked with China and Russia will be in China and Russia's \\nsphere of influence. The United States is hoping to leapfrog to \\nsome radically different nuclear technology, but China and \\nRussia are helping those countries build the equivalent of \\nlarge, light-water reactors that we are building in Georgia.\\n    So what I would do is I would say, look, we need to compete \\nproperly. That means that we need to compete with Chinese and \\nRussian state-owned nuclear companies. We need a national \\nchampion. We do it differently in the United States; we have \\nprivate companies. That would probably be something like \\nBechtel, which is involved in building two nuclear reactors in \\nGeorgia. After those workers get done building those two \\nreactors, they could move up the road to South Carolina, \\ncomplete construction of two reactors there in summer.\\n    And then, after that, we have construction crews--I mean, \\nanybody that is apocalyptic about climate change should view \\nthe construction managers and workers at the Georgian nuclear \\nplants as a national treasure, as an international treasure. \\nBecause it is these men and women who have the experience \\nbuilding our most complex form of energy and have the \\nexperience to compete with experienced Russian and Chinese \\ncrews all over the world.\\n    This should be a serious national priority. I think we are \\njust sleepwalking into a disastrous situation where our \\neconomic rivals, but also our global security rivals, are \\npursuing nuclear aggressively while we are withdrawing from it, \\nnot just globally but also domestically.\\n    And then I would just say one final thing, Congressman, is \\nthat, clearly, the winning combination for energy dominance is \\nto do what the Russians and the United Arab Emirates are \\nplanning on doing, which is to build nuclear plants to replace \\nnatural gas and fossil fuel usage at home, and then you export \\nyour natural gas abroad. That gives additional geopolitical \\npower and significant revenue for American businesses and \\nworkers.\\n    Mr. Graves. And reduces global emissions.\\n    Mr. Shellenberger. And significantly reduces global \\nemissions. I mean, the great news is that there is so much \\nabundant natural gas there is no reason that we are going to \\nneed to see any significant increase in coal burning over the \\nnext century.\\n    Mr. Graves. Thank you.\\n    And a last quick question--thank you very much, Mr. \\nShellenberger--for Mr. Walsh. I, too, share a lot of the \\nobjectives that Mr. Walsh communicated. But, in looking at the \\nstrategy--Mr. Walsh, you largely represent labor.\\n    Number one, the Biden climate plan, which largely reflects \\nthe one the committee put forth, it didn't include any labor \\nrepresentatives, any business representatives in the team that \\nwas devising that plan, putting it together.\\n    Secondly, right now, we are 100--I want to remind folks--if \\nyou can go on mute, that would be great. I want to remind \\nfolks, in China, we are dependent upon China for 17 critical \\nminerals today. Eighty percent of the rare earths we are \\ndependent upon China for.\\n    Do you believe that labor should have been represented on \\nthe Biden task force?\\n    And, number two, do you believe that we should increase our \\ndomestic production of these critical and rare earths here in \\nthe United States to ensure that we are creating jobs right \\nhere in America?\\n    Mr. Walsh. Thank you for the two-part question, \\nRepresentative Graves. Let me attempt to address the first one, \\nand hopefully I will have time for the second.\\n    So I believe you are referring to the Biden Unity Task \\nForce. I am trying to remember now who was on that task force, \\nbut, if I remember correctly, a task force that includes \\nRepresentative McEachin, Chair Castor, Representative Lamb of \\nPennsylvania, and Representative Ocasio-Cortez represents a \\npretty good diversity of viewpoints within the Democratic \\nParty.\\n    I think that the breadth of perspective is reflected in \\ntheir recommendations, which, again, I am trying to remember \\noff the top of my head, but they include protecting clean air \\nand clean water in our public lands, strengthening \\nenvironmental justice, rebuilding our infrastructure, \\ndramatically expanding clean-energy deployment, ensuring job \\nquality in clean energy sectors. These are broadly popular \\npositions with the American public, and not just----\\n    Mr. Graves. Sure. And just to clarify the record, there \\nwere four environmentalists that were on the task force in \\naddition to folks you mentioned, yet no labor or business \\nrepresentatives. But please continue.\\n    Mr. Walsh [continuing]. With----\\n    Ms. Castor. The time has expired. But it gives me an \\nopportunity to thank Ranking Member Graves for his concern over \\nthe Democratic platform. We usually don't talk politics on \\nthese calls. But don't worry. Yesterday, the platform committee \\npassed the platform, and it was rife with labor \\nrepresentatives. I will send you over the list.\\n    And this also gives me an opportunity--I was going to hold \\nthis unanimous consent request until later, but I think it is \\nimportant to do now to make sure it is on the record, in \\nresponse to claims that renewables increase energy costs.\\n    The International Renewable Energy Agency recently reported \\nthat electricity costs from renewables, such as solar and wind, \\nhave decreased dramatically over the last decade, resulting in \\nrenewable power generation technologies becoming the least cost \\nnew technology, new capacity options in almost every part of \\nthe world.\\n    Moreover, on average, building new solar voltaic and on-\\nshore wind power costs less than operating many existing coal \\nplants.\\n    So, without objection, I would like to enter into the \\nrecord the IRENA report titled ``Renewable Power Generation \\nCosts in 2019.''\\n    Mr. Graves. Madam Chair, reserving the right to object, as \\nI recall, at our last hearing, there was an objection on our \\nunanimous consent requests in order to review those documents. \\nAnd so I would like to allow the minority the same right for \\nthese documents, if you don't mind.\\n    And if those are the most cost-competitive, then perhaps we \\ncould remove the PTC and ITC.\\n    Ms. Castor. I think it would be very helpful if you would \\nread the report.\\n    So, at this time, I will recognize Mr. Lujan for 5 minutes.\\n    Mr. Lujan. Thank you so much, Madam Chair.\\n    Mr. Walsh, do Americans have to choose between creating \\ngood jobs and protecting the environment?\\n    Mr. Walsh. Thank you for the question, Congressman Lujan.\\n    No, they do not. That is, in fact, a false choice. We can \\nand we must have both.\\n    There are numerous instances in the committee's report that \\nI think show this powerfully. I think it is particularly \\ninteresting to look at some of the job creation estimates \\nassociated with reaching a 90-percent or 100-percent carbon-\\nfree grid by 2040, right, where we look at job estimates that \\nare in the neighborhood of half a million annually. Those are \\nsignificant.\\n    We also have to pay attention to job quality. We have to \\nprotect the rights of workers to organize. We need to include \\nvery clear prevailing wage and Buy America standards. We don't \\ndo that well enough to date, and we need to do it better, \\nparticularly in our use of tax credit policy.\\n    But we can most certainly create good jobs, sustain good \\njobs, and protect our climate and create a living environment \\nfor everybody.\\n    Mr. Lujan. Mr. Walsh, can you share some examples of good, \\nunion jobs in the clean energy sector?\\n    Mr. Walsh. Well, there are many. One of my favorite \\nexamples is the offshore wind farm, the first grid-connected \\noffshore wind farm in the country, off of the State of Rhode \\nIsland, at Block Island. That was a very small wind farm; it is \\nnow producing 50 megawatts. But it created jobs for 300 \\nbuilding trade workers across 10 different local unions under a \\nproject labor agreement.\\n    Keep in mind, that is a very small project, whereas we now \\nhave states up and down the mid-Atlantic and northeastern coast \\nthat have teed up commitments for 20 gigawatts of offshore \\nwind. The job creation estimates of that on an annual basis \\nrange anywhere from 122,000 to a little over 200,000 jobs per \\nyear.\\n    Mr. Lujan. Appreciate that. Thank you, Mr. Walsh.\\n    Dr. Baptista, I am one of the co-authors of the Clean \\nEnergy Standard Act. I was proud to partner with my colleagues \\nin the House and with United States Senator Tina Smith. We know \\nthat a nationwide clean electricity standard also means less \\nair pollution and healthier communities and longer lives.\\n    Dr. Baptista, what can America do to ensure that \\nunderserved frontline communities, who we know are suffering \\nfrom air pollution, benefit from a nationwide clean energy \\nstandard?\\n    Dr. Baptista. Thank you, Representative Lujan.\\n    I believe that when we shift to clean energy sources, like \\nwind and solar, in our energy production, we also have the very \\nimmediate benefits of reducing co-pollutants, those pollutants \\nlike particulate matter that have health harming impacts in \\nnear-adjacent communities to these energy-producing facilities.\\n    And when we look across the country, we know that much of \\nthe infrastructure, the current infrastructure, fossil fuel \\ninfrastructure in the country resides in communities of color \\nand low-wealth communities, who are impacted not only by the \\nglobal greenhouse gases that come from traditional fossil fuel \\nenergy production but the co-pollutants that have immediate \\nhealth impacts on those communities.\\n    And so, when we talk about a national clean energy standard \\nand the shifting of our energy production to cleaner sources, \\nlike wind and solar, what we see is a concomitant reduction in \\nair pollutants that harm people today. So this is very, very \\nimportant that we insist on the driving down not only of \\nCO2 but of these co-pollutants that have health \\nimpacts on local communities.\\n    And, furthermore, we know that, as we shift to renewable \\nenergy sources, there are also opportunities created in \\ncommunities of color and low-income communities that have \\nhistorically not had the same opportunities for employment in \\nthese traditional industries. And new opportunities can open up \\nfor both economic development and an improvement in air quality \\nand public health for communities that have been hard-hit by \\neconomic and environmental harms in the past.\\n    Mr. Lujan. Thank you, Dr. Baptista.\\n    Madam Chair, as the clock winds down here, it is good to \\nhear the ranking member's support for union jobs across the \\ncountry.\\n    I look forward to partnering with you, Mr. Graves, and \\nseeing what pro-union legislation we can work on together.\\n    My father, my late father, was a union ironworker. My \\nbrother is IBEW; my grandfather, a union carpenter. So it is \\ngood to see that we can find some bipartisan support there, \\nMadam Chair, and do look forward to working with all my \\ncolleagues as we move forward.\\n    Thank you to all the panelists.\\n    Mr. Graves. Absolutely.\\n    Ms. Castor. Thank you, Mr. Lujan.\\n    And, Mr. Carter, you are recognized for 5 minutes.\\n    Mr. Carter. Well, thank you, Madam Chair.\\n    And, Mr. Lujan, thank you very much for that. My father was \\na union paper maker. So it is not something that is unique to \\njust Democrats; it is also something that Republicans enjoy as \\nwell.\\n    Madam Chair and members of the panel, it seems that we have \\nbeen focusing a lot on the economics of this and the economics \\nof the clean energy. And I am a little bit confused here when I \\nhear the chairlady mention that renewable energy is so much \\ncheaper than traditional energy and then I hear the ranking \\nmember cite examples of how much more expensive in California \\nthe petroleum is, how much more expensive the energy is, and \\nthe two of them just don't seem to jive. So I am a little bit \\nconfused there.\\n    But I do want to mention that the majority staff's report \\nthat came out, it is obvious it would make it even more \\nexpensive and difficult in the U.S. to be competitive with \\nenergy prices than it would elsewhere. And that means that more \\njobs would go to China and that means that more jobs would go \\nto areas that are not as environmentally conscious as we are \\nhere in the U.S.\\n    In fact, it is estimated that, within the next decade, 90 \\npercent of all the emissions will come from outside the U.S. \\nAnd one of the ways that the majority staff's report suggests \\nthat we should counter that is with the carbon tax that \\nadvocates for border adjustment mechanisms, such as the carbon \\ntax, so that we can level the playing field.\\n     I wanted to ask you, Mr. Shellenberger, do you think that \\nthat is really an effective way to encourage other nations to \\nreduce their emissions?\\n    Mr. Shellenberger. Yeah, thank you. And I also would like \\nto address that, because there is--first of all, if solar and \\nwind are cheaper than existing energy sources, why would they \\nneed subsidies? Why would they need to be mandated? I think \\nthat somebody needs to address that issue. In other words, why \\nwould we spend $2 trillion on solar and wind, and the \\ntransmission lines, if they are already cheaper than existing \\nenergy sources?\\n    The second issue is that they are not. And so what they are \\nmeasuring is, if you take a solar panel, buy a solar panel from \\nChina and you measure the cost of that electricity at that \\nmoment, yes, it is cheaper than the existing grid, but that \\nsolar panel doesn't provide reliable electricity.\\n    And so the economic and environmental costs of industrial \\nsolar and wind projects are externalized, first, onto the \\nnatural environment--you are talking 300 to 400 times more \\nland--second, onto ratepayers, who have to pay to have other \\npower plants operating or some other kind of way to store that \\nelectricity so you can have reliable electricity.\\n    That is the mechanism that the University of Chicago and \\nother analysts have all identified as why renewables-heavy \\nstates and countries, like California and Germany, have much \\nmore expensive electricity.\\n    On the issue of the carbon tax, you know, I personally \\nwould have no problem with a very low price on carbon, you \\nknow, somewhere between $1 and $5 per ton, if that money were \\nused to benefit something positive. Because, you know, it is \\nnot a bad thing to tax bads and invest in goods. But that is \\nnot going to drive energy transitions.\\n    What drives energy transitions, whether from wood to coal \\nor wood to hydroelectricity or coal to natural gas, is the same \\nthing that drove the energy transition from coal to natural gas \\nin the United States, which is that the cost of natural gas \\ncame down because we opened up shales for fracking and so \\nnatural gas became cheaper than coal. That is the mechanism. We \\ndidn't subsidize natural gas into becoming cheaper than coal. \\nWe also didn't tax coal to becoming much more expensive than \\nnatural gas.\\n    So I don't think we need to be super rigid about it. I \\nmean, if there were some broader compromise where there was \\nsome price on carbon that benefited positive things, great. But \\nI think it is silly to imagine that making fossil fuels \\nslightly more expensive is going to somehow make the difference \\nbetween it and significantly cleaner sources of energy.\\n    Mr. Carter. Good.\\n    Mr. Shellenberger. If you want a national nuclear program, \\nwe need a national nuclear program, full stop. If we want to \\ntransition from coal to natural gas, we need to make natural \\ngas cheaper.\\n    Mr. Carter. I want to jump on that. I have just a few \\nseconds left. But you mentioned the nuclear plants, and you \\nmentioned in Georgia. It is right above my district in Georgia.\\n    And my question is, what is the biggest hurdle to nuclear \\nenergy in America? Why is it that even environmentalists are \\nopposed to nuclear energy, when we know that it is green, we \\nknow that it is one of the cleanest forms of energy out there?\\n    Mr. Shellenberger. Well, I think one of the big reasons is \\nbecause, if you do a lot of nuclear power, you don't need any \\nrenewables. I mean, France shows that you can do 75 percent \\nnuclear of your electricity grid. Like I said, France's \\nelectricity is 10 times less carbon intensive than Germany's, \\nand they spend a little bit more than half as much for their \\nelectricity. These are two real world cases that last over \\ndecades.\\n    So, if you are absolutely in love with renewables and you \\nthink they are a way to harmonize human civilization with the \\nnatural world, which they are not, then nuclear is a threat to \\nthat vision. If you are trying to get control over the energy \\neconomy, nuclear is a threat to that vision.\\n    There are still lingering concerns about nuclear weapons, \\nbut the fact of the matter is, the United States already has \\nnuclear capability. It is not like it is going to change that.\\n    So there is also--in my book, ``Apocalypse Never,'' I \\ndescribe the history of how the Democrats have opposed nuclear \\npower for a long time for, I think, reasons that don't have \\nmuch to do with the environment at all.\\n    Mr. Carter. Okay.\\n    I am out of time. Thank you for your indulgence, Madam \\nChair. Thank you, and I yield back.\\n    Ms. Castor. Well, thank you, Mr. Carter.\\n    And two things that the gentleman from Georgia forgot: one, \\nall the timber in your state and all of the solar energy as \\nwell.\\n    Ms. Bonamici, you are recognized for 5 minutes.\\n    Ms. Bonamici. Thank you so much, Madam Chair.\\n    And thank you to all of our witnesses today.\\n    We are in an unprecedented moment in our nation's history. \\nWith coronavirus cases surging and unemployment rates climbing, \\nour communities are having these long overdue conversations \\nabout systemic racism. But even in this moment in history when \\nour communities are struggling and we have inequities that are \\nexacerbated and highlighted, the climate crisis is continuing, \\nand we cannot and must not wait any longer to take action.\\n    And I am proud of this bold, science-based, comprehensive \\nclimate action plan. Building a resilient, clean energy economy \\nusing our climate action framework is going to boost our \\neconomic recovery at a time when we desperately need it but \\nalso allow us to begin to repair the legacy of environmental \\nracism and pollution that has disproportionately burdened low-\\nincome communities and communities of color for decades.\\n    And I want to start with Mr. Walsh. We really appreciated \\nthe BlueGreen Alliance's engagement in drafting the climate \\naction plan and your work to highlight the economic \\nopportunities of addressing the climate crisis.\\n    So, as a leader on the Education and Labor Committee and \\nthe granddaughter of a coal miner, I know that how we \\ntransition to a clean energy economy and support workers is as \\nimportant as the transition itself. So I am working on the \\nrecommendation that we have that you mentioned in your \\ntestimony, to create a national economic transition office. I \\nam working on that as a stand-alone bill.\\n    So I want to ask, what are the most effective strategies to \\nhelp workers prepare for those future transformations and avoid \\ndisplacement? And how could a centralized office better help \\ndisplaced or dislocated workers access the targeted support \\nservices and resources they need?\\n    Mr. Walsh. Thank you for the question, Congresswoman. It \\nacknowledges that America is already in the middle of an energy \\ntransition, right? And we need to have a conversation and we \\nneed to enact policies that get ahead of this transition, and \\nwe need to do it now.\\n    I mentioned in my testimony the ``National Economic \\nTransition Platform,'' which outlines a set of policy \\nrecommendations focused on communities and workers hit hard by \\nthe decline of the coal industry, where that transition is most \\nimpactful at this point.\\n    One of the key ideas put forward in that platform, as you \\nmentioned, is the need for a new Federal office that would \\nalign, scale up, and target Federal resources for affected \\nworkers and communities and coordinate across different \\nagencies within the Federal Government, particularly agencies \\nthat are focused on economic and workforce development.\\n    We think creating an office of economic transition--call it \\nwhat you want--is really key. In addition to synchronizing and \\naligning efforts across the Federal Government, it can also \\nleverage new public- and private-sector investments.\\n    And we also think this is an office that should be guided \\nby an advisory board that is reflective of affected stakeholder \\ngroups and communities, including labor and local leaders.\\n    The recommendations to create----\\n    Ms. Bonamici. Absolutely.\\n    Mr. Walsh [continuing]. To create that kind of office are--\\nwe also have six other recommendations, and I am happy to share \\nthose with you when we have more time.\\n    Ms. Bonamici. Terrific. Thank you so much.\\n    And, Dr. Baptista, I appreciate in your testimony you \\nnoted, ``Without an intentional focus on equity and justice, we \\nwill replicate the same disparities.''\\n    So, throughout our conversations with the Affiliated Tribes \\nof Northwest Indians and the National Congress of American \\nIndians, we identified exclusionary provisions in Federal \\nfunding programs for Tribal nations. So the climate action plan \\nwill remedy those gaps and also better acknowledge traditional \\nlands and waters that Tribes access under their treaty rights, \\nand which the Federal Government's historical injustices and \\nfailure to honor those rights--we need to address those as \\nwell.\\n    So how have historical failures to invest in environmental \\njustice communities and other underserved populations, how have \\nthey exacerbated inequities? And how can Congress better \\nincorporate the principles of the ``Equitable and Just National \\nClimate Platform'' in making future funding decisions?\\n    Dr. Baptista. Thank you, Congresswoman, for the question.\\n    I think it is really critical that we center equity and \\njustice. The ``National Equitable and Just Climate Platform'' \\ntries to really drive home this point, that we can't continue \\nto reproduce the same status quo policies that often leave out \\ncommunities of color and historically disenfranchised \\ncommunities that have not have the same access to employment \\nopportunities and different economic development scenarios.\\n    So we want to ensure that, as we move to a renewable \\neconomy, as we move to greener and healthier forms of \\nmanufacturing and production, that the communities that have \\nbeen the sacrifice zones and have had to live with the harms of \\nenvironmental pollution start to reap some of those benefits.\\n    And how do we do that? One of the key ways that we do that \\nis early consultation and input from environmental justice \\nstakeholders on the ground that know these issues very well. \\nThere are fenceline and frontline communities around the \\ncountry who have deep knowledge in these areas. And also by \\nensuring that we have explicit targets for employment in low- \\nand moderate-income communities and people of color \\ncommunities.\\n    Ms. Bonamici. Perfect. Thank you so much.\\n    And I yield back. Thank you, Madam Chair.\\n    Ms. Castor. Thank you.\\n    Mrs. Miller, good to see you. You are recognized for 5 \\nminutes.\\n    Mrs. Miller. Thank you, Madam Chair.\\n    I don't think that there is any doubt that my State of West \\nVirginia has taken the brunt of bad policy, unfunded mandates, \\nand the Democrat regulatory agenda, which is evidenced by the \\nimpact on jobs in our coal communities.\\n    We have been fortunate, as jobs related to natural gas have \\nincreased in my state. Not only has natural gas provided new \\nand high-paying jobs to Appalachia, it is a vital resource to \\nour energy security, our national security, and to reducing \\nglobal emissions.\\n    Dr. Baptista, Ms. Soholt, and Mr. Walsh, thank you all for \\nbeing here today. I am glad that we have experts here before \\nus.\\n    Do you all know how many cubic meters of natural gas the EU \\nconsumes each year? The answer is 457.2 billion cubic meters.\\n    Of the natural gas that Europe consumes, do you know what \\npercentage of it comes from Russia? The percentage is 38.8 \\npercent.\\n    Does anyone know what total global carbon emissions were in \\n2018? Thirty-three-point-three gigatons, or 33 billion metric \\ntons.\\n    Now, if we can help our EU allies switch from dirty and \\ndangerous Russian natural gas to cleaner and more secure \\nAmerican natural gas, global emissions could fall by more than \\n62 million metric tons a year.\\n    Given the United States emitted 5.28 billion metric tons of \\ncarbon a year, we could effectively offset U.S. carbon \\nemissions by 1.2 percent. This may not sound like a whole lot, \\nbut it would be like bringing down carbon emissions by almost \\n50 percent in each and every one of our congressional \\ndistricts.\\n    Just last week, I introduced a bill, the ESCAPE Act, or the \\nEnergy Security Cooperation with Allied Partners in Europe Act, \\nand it is designed to reduce the influence of Vladimir Putin on \\nour allies by promoting U.S. energy exports to Europe.\\n    Even if you don't care about our national interests, if you \\ncare about climate change, you should join me on this bill, as \\nRussian natural gas exports to Europe have a lifecycle emission \\nprofile of at least 40-percent higher than U.S. LNG. If my \\ncolleagues believe the climate crisis to be urgent and dire, \\nthen I hope they will support my bill, which will have a \\nmassive and immediate positive impact on global carbon \\nemissions.\\n    I yield back.\\n    Ms. Castor. Thank you, Mrs. Miller.\\n    Next, Rep. McEachin, you are recognized for 5 minutes.\\n    Mr. McEachin. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you for \\nbringing today's hearing together.\\n    And to our distinguished panelists, we thank you for your \\ntime and your expertise.\\n    Dr. Baptista, thank you for your very kind written \\ntestimony where you mentioned the work of Chairman Grijalva and \\nmyself. That was very kind of you. It has been a pleasure \\nworking with him as well as many incredible leaders, including \\nthe members of the ``Equitable and Just National Climate \\nPlatform,'' to advance priorities that reduce emissions, \\nimprove public health, and stimulate economic growth.\\n    Jason Walsh, it is very good to see you. I have had the \\nprivilege of working with you over the past few years on \\npolicies to address our climate crisis in a way that creates \\nand maintains high-quality jobs and ensures a just and \\nequitable transition for communities.\\n    As I have said many times before, nothing is more important \\nthan speeding our transition to a cleaner, more sustainable \\neconomy. It is the only way to deliver an equitable, healthy \\nfuture. Building a clean economy will enhance economic \\nopportunity, creating well-paying, family-sustaining jobs for \\nthose who need them most. And by reducing climate change \\npollution, it will improve public health. Additionally, it will \\ngive us the opportunity to address longstanding wrongs, to \\ncorrect decades old environmental injustices that are still \\nhurting communities today.\\n    The Federal Government has a critical role to play in this \\nfight, and it is essential that we advance carefully \\nconstructed policies that address these longstanding injustices \\nand meet the challenge of our climate crisis.\\n    Dr. Baptista, to that end, as we continue our transition to \\na clean energy economy, how can the Federal Government ensure \\nthat environmental justice communities shape investments in \\ntheir communities? How can investments be made in partnership \\nwith EJ communities while reducing emissions and stimulating \\neconomic growth?\\n    Dr. Baptista. Thank you, Representative McEachin. And thank \\nyou so much for your leadership on environmental justice \\nissues.\\n    We know how to do this. We know who the environmental \\njustice communities are across the country. There are \\ncommunity-based organizations and nonprofits around the country \\nwho know their communities well and can participate as key \\nstakeholders as we develop these programs in renewable energy \\nand energy efficiency.\\n    We know that there are certain investments in energy \\nefficiency and renewable energy that can create local jobs, but \\nwe need input early and often from those local stakeholders, \\nlocal municipalities, and NGOs that can help guide that work \\nand also direct the investment to ensure that there is greater \\naccess to those who have been disenfranchised and have barriers \\nto employment.\\n    So we need to follow the model that the ``Equitable and \\nJust Climate National Platform'' set for us, which is a good \\ncollaboration on the development of those policies and in \\nsetting targets for local hiring and local investments to go to \\ncommunities that need it most.\\n    Mr. McEachin. Thank you.\\n    Madam Chair, just so you know--staff can help me out--I \\ndon't see the clock on my screen. I don't know if it is \\nsomething I am doing or not, but I don't want to run over my \\ntime accidentally.\\n    Ms. Castor. You have a minute and a half.\\n    Mr. McEachin. Thank you.\\n    Doctor, what lessons have you learned throughout your work \\nthat can and should be applied to climate policy development at \\nthe Federal level?\\n    Dr. Baptista. I mean, I think that I am going to reiterate \\nwhat I said in my comments, which is that equity and racial \\njustice does not happen by coincidence. It has to be an \\nintentional thing that we build into all of our national \\nclimate and energy policies.\\n    We need to intentionally carve out opportunities for \\nimproving the quality of life and reducing legacy pollution in \\ncommunities, but also for ensuring access to the benefits of a \\ntransition to a cleaner economy.\\n    And so, without that intentional and explicit commitment to \\nracial justice and equity in our national energy policies, they \\nwill not, you know, happen by chance. So I would recommend that \\nwe all focus our energies on equitable and just outcomes in \\nthese policies.\\n    Mr. McEachin. Thank you, ma'am.\\n    And, Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time, if \\nany.\\n    Ms. Castor. Thank you, Rep. McEachin.\\n    Next, we will go to Rep. Palmer, if he can turn on his \\nvideo.\\n    If not, we will go ahead to Mr. Levin.\\n    All right, let's go to Mr. Levin.\\n    And for those of you--to see the clock, I believe you need \\nto be in grid view. So, if you see that icon and hover over it, \\nit will give you an option for--I think it is the four dots \\ngrid view. If you click that, you will be able to see the \\nclock.\\n    So, Mr. Levin, you are recognized for 5 minutes.\\n    Mr. Levin. Well, thank you very much, Chair Castor, for \\nyour great leadership and for this discussion today.\\n    Before I begin, I would just like to remind my friend Mr. \\nGraves, who took it upon himself to criticize California, that, \\naccording to the EIA, my home state has the second lowest per \\ncapita carbon dioxide emissions in the nation, only behind New \\nYork.\\n    And I am very proud of that and the leadership that we have \\nshown, that you can put in place strong policies to protect the \\nenvironment and build the clean energy jobs of the future at \\nthe same time.\\n    And I would remind my friend Mr. Graves that his home State \\nof Louisiana has the fifth highest per capita CO2 \\nemissions in the nation.\\n    Mr. Graves. Will the gentleman yield?\\n    Mr. Levin. So I hope we can agree that growing clean-energy \\njobs is really more important than ever, since unemployment----\\n    Mr. Graves. Will the gentleman yield?\\n    Mr. Levin [continuing]. Has skyrocketed due do COVID.\\n    With that, I will turn to some questions.\\n    Ms. Soholt, I have introduced bipartisan legislation called \\nPLREDA, the Public Land Renewable Energy Development Act, which \\nsets up a smart-from-the-start planning framework for renewable \\nenergy generation on our public lands.\\n    This approach is better for developers and better for \\nconsumers, ultimately helps facilitate more renewable energy \\nprojects. And the Natural Resources Committee has unanimously \\napproved the bill, and I hope will it be considered soon on the \\nHouse floor.\\n    Ms. Soholt, do you think this sort of smart-from-the-start \\napproach is effective for transmission as well? And if so, how \\nshould it be implemented?\\n    Ms. Soholt. Thank you, Representative, for the question.\\n    First, if I may answer just briefly my fellow panelist, Mr. \\nShellenberger, and talk about unsubsidized cost of wind and \\nsolar compared to other fields.\\n    Lazard does a report every year. And wind and solar, \\nunsubsidized, no ITC/PTC, are the cheapest forms of new \\ngeneration. That report is available every year. So it does not \\ncomport with what we are hearing from Mr. Shellenberger today.\\n    As far as being unreliable, the Southwest Power Pool has \\nhad over 70 percent of their energy delivered to customers from \\nwind just this summer. And so the fact that wind and solar are \\nnot reliable is not true.\\n    As far as the land use goes, I think what Mr. \\nShellenberger's oversized land estimates account for is that he \\nis looking at the entire footprint of a wind farm, for example. \\nA wind turbine takes up very little land, maybe a quarter of an \\nacre, and you can farm or graze right up to the base of that \\nturbine. And so the estimates about land use Mr. Shellenberger \\nis talking about are far exaggerated.\\n    So, Representative Levin, thank you for your question.\\n    We have seen in the Midwest that utilities who are out \\ntalking to communities, Tribal lands representatives--we don't \\nhave a lot of Federal land in the Midwest, I will have to \\nadmit. That is more in other areas of the country. But I think \\nwhat we have learned is that fighting large infrastructure, no \\nmatter what, is a complicated and time-consuming process.\\n    Anything that we can do at the beginning of the process to \\nhave a conversation about how to prudently site, whether it is \\na transmission line or new power generation, new renewable \\ngeneration, is time well spent.\\n    Mr. Levin. Thank you for that.\\n    Mr. Walsh, as I am sure you know, the Trump EPA is rolling \\nback the light-duty vehicle greenhouse gas emission standard \\nset by the last administration. This will cost consumers at \\nleast $175 billion more at the pump and result in the emission \\nof an additional 867 million metric tons of carbon pollution at \\nleast.\\n    Our report recommends we ratchet these standards back up as \\nwell as set standards for clean medium- and heavy-duty trucks. \\nAnd, in your testimony, you mentioned that building cleaner \\ncars and trucks is an important part of the clean energy \\neconomy that creates good jobs.\\n    What are the jobs impacts of rolling back the light-duty \\nvehicle standards? And can you talk a bit more about the jobs \\nand environmental potential of clean trucks?\\n    Mr. Walsh. Yes. And I will try to be brief. I know we are \\nrunning out of time.\\n    The rollback of the fuel economy and greenhouse gas \\nemissions standards by the Trump administration was a job \\nkiller. By the Administration's own estimates, we will lose \\ntens of thousands of jobs that we otherwise would have had in \\nautomotive supply chains, building hybrids, building advanced \\nfuel economy technologies both across light-duty vehicles and \\nmedium-duty vehicles as well.\\n    So it is a step back, which is why it was opposed by such a \\nbroad cross-section of stakeholders, including labor unions.\\n    Mr. Levin. Thank you.\\n    I am out of time, but I appreciate all your testimony and \\nyour being with us.\\n    Thank you, Chair Castor. I yield back.\\n    Ms. Castor. Thank you, Mr. Levin.\\n    Mr. Casten, you are recognized for 5 minutes.\\n    Mr. Casten. Thank you, Madam Chair.\\n    I have to tell you, I am a little frustrated here. We have \\nhad 18 months of pretty good, pretty bipartisan hearings, with \\na recognition that climate is an emergency and we need to deal \\nwith facts. My colleagues across the aisle are just making \\nstuff up today. You have a witness who is making stuff up.\\n    I would like to introduce--with unanimous consent, would \\nask to introduce into the record an article from \\nclimatefeedback.org entitled ``Article By Michael Shellenberger \\nMixes Accurate and Inaccurate Claims in Support of a Misleading \\nand Overly Simplistic Argumentation About Climate Change.''\\n    Ms. Castor. Without----\\n    Mr. Graves. Madam Chair, I am going to reserve the right to \\nobject.\\n    Ms. Castor [continuing]. All right.\\n    Mr. Casten. Garret, do me a favor----\\n    Ms. Castor. Please have your--Mr. Casten, please have your \\nstaff submit the document to our repository. Thank you.\\n    Mr. Casten [continuing]. We will do.\\n    And, Ranking Member Graves, if you don't like the document, \\nplease read it. Read it, and then come to my office, and let's \\ntalk.\\n    Mr. Graves. Happy to do it. Thank you.\\n    Mr. Casten. These are scientists refuting almost everything \\nthat Mr. Shellenberger has said. It is from an article that he \\nwrote on June 28 of this year substantially consistent with his \\ntestimony.\\n    We do not have time on this committee to make things up. I \\nhave spent 20 years in the clean energy industry, and Mr. \\nShellenberger doesn't understand energy markets either.\\n    Mr. Shellenberger, I am not going to ask you questions, \\nbecause it would be a waste of my time.\\n    I am going to ask questions, though, of Ms. Soholt, because \\nyou have a lot of experience in the Midwest System Operator.\\n    I am looking right now at the MISO spot price of power, and \\nit says that, at the Illinois hub, the price of power is about \\n$28 a megawatt hour. As I understand it right, and I would ask \\nyou to confirm, that means that any generator who has a \\nmarginal operating cost below that level is going to operate. \\nIs that about right, Ms. Soholt?\\n    Ms. Soholt. Yes, that is true.\\n    Mr. Casten. Okay. So help me understand, what is the \\nmarginal operating cost of a solar panel that is deciding \\nwhether to dispatch into that market?\\n    Ms. Soholt. I would not know that off the top of my head, \\nbut I would be glad to get you that information.\\n    Mr. Casten. Well, does it take any fuel to burn a solar \\npanel, to----\\n    Ms. Soholt. It does not.\\n    Mr. Casten [continuing]. Run a solar panel?\\n    Ms. Soholt. It does not.\\n    Mr. Casten. Do you typically hire an operator, if you put a \\nsolar panel on your roof, to run it that you have to pay a \\nsalary to?\\n    Ms. Soholt. No.\\n    Mr. Casten. So it is darn close to zero, sounds like.\\n    How about a wind turbine? Does a wind turbine have a high \\nmargin--I am not talking about the cost of capital. A wind \\nturbine, does that have a very high marginal operating cost?\\n    Ms. Soholt. No, Representative. Last time I checked, wind \\nand sun are free.\\n    Mr. Casten. Okay.\\n    How about a nuclear plant? What is the marginal operating \\ncost of a nuclear plant?\\n    Ms. Soholt. It would have a higher cost than $28.\\n    Mr. Casten. Would it be lower than a coal plant or higher \\nthan a coal plant?\\n    Ms. Soholt. Well, that is a rather complicated answer, \\nbecause a nuke in MISO would probably be a must-run facility. \\nNuke plants do not ramp well up and down, and so they need to \\nbasically run flat out. And so I don't think they would be on \\nthe margin. Coal and gas are going to be more on the margin. \\nBut they would have substantially higher operating costs than \\nwind or solar.\\n    Mr. Casten. Fair point.\\n    And does MISO provide any guarantee of capital recovery? If \\nyou build a plant, are you guaranteed to earn your target \\nreturn on capital, or do you just make a marginal dollar, not \\nevery hour?\\n    Ms. Soholt. MISO has nothing to do with cost recovery.\\n    Mr. Casten. Okay.\\n    And the reason I ask those questions is because, when we \\npassed the Energy Policy Act in 1992 and FERC Order 888, we \\ncreated MISO, we created PJM, we created all these power \\nmarkets, and we started dispatching assets based on the lowest \\nmarginal power supply.\\n    Ms. Soholt. Right.\\n    Mr. Casten. Since that time, the nuclear fleet went from 60 \\nto 90 percent capacity factor. We built 200,000 megawatts of \\ncombined cycle that was almost twice the efficiency of the \\nexisting gas fleet. We built about 50,000 megawatts of \\nrenewables.\\n    Now, for context, there is about 1,000 gigawatts on the \\ngrid. So 5 percent of the grid now is renewables, 20 percent is \\ncombined cycle.\\n    The price of power since that period has fallen by over 6 \\npercent, and the CO2 emissions per megawatt hour \\nhave fallen by over 26 percent.\\n    For people to sit here on this committee and say the \\ndeployment of clean energy is driving up the cost of power are \\nliving in fantasy land. Just imagine what we could do if we \\ndidn't spend our time putting denialists and deniers before us.\\n    We have the opportunity to act. We have the opportunity to \\nlower power prices. We have the opportunity to make the world \\ncleaner. We have the opportunity to create good construction \\njobs. For goodness sake, let's do it.\\n    Ms. Soholt. And, Representative, if I could just add one \\nfinal thought. You know, the wholesale power prices in MISO \\nhave gone down dramatically in the last 10 years, and MISO has \\nover 20,000 megawatts of wind and solar online currently today.\\n    Utilities are purchasing wind and solar because they are \\neconomic, reliable resources, and they know how to run the grid \\nwith that robust amount of renewables on the grid.\\n    Mr. Casten. Thank you.\\n    Thank you. I yield back.\\n    Ms. Castor. Thank you, Mr. Casten.\\n    Mr. Huffman, you are recognized for 5 minutes.\\n    Mr. Huffman. Well, thank you, Madam Chair.\\n    And I want to share the frustration that we heard from my \\ncolleague, Sean Casten. I had hoped for a productive \\nconversation about climate solutions and the great economic \\nupside of pursuing this clean energy future, and, instead, our \\nfriends across the aisle called someone who is not a scientist, \\nnot an economist. He is a guy with an anthropology degree that \\nholds himself out as an expert on a whole bunch of subjects, \\nbut he has really not.\\n    And for those of us that know his shtick, as I do, sadly, \\nfrom years of experiencing it, you know that he has spent his \\ncareer creating, publicizing, and monetizing a totally fake \\nnarrative that he is some sort of a fallen angel from high \\nlevels of the environmental community, but he has seen the \\nlight, and he is now speaking truth to environmental power by \\nattacking renewables and climate leadership from the \\nenvironmental community.\\n    It is complete bunk. And all of us were cheapened a little \\nbit, a few moments ago, when he actually gave the title of his \\nbook that he is out promoting. And that is really what this is \\nall about. It is what it is always about. We shouldn't be \\ntalking about pimping one's book under the guise of \\ncongressional testimony.\\n    In any event, I am glad that the article is now going to be \\nin the record from climatefeedback.org. Anyone that has \\nquestions about this really should read it, because you have \\nsix real scientists that take to task and dismantle all of the \\ntropes that you heard in Mr. Shellenberger's testimony today, \\nall of the tropes in the new book that he is hocking around the \\ncountry. So have a good look at that.\\n    And the fact that they have dismantled and debunked these \\nthings means that I don't have to. So I can bring my time to \\nbear on a more productive conversation with the witnesses here \\nwho want to help us solve the climate crisis.\\n    And, Ms. Soholt, I want to ask you about that, because we \\ncontinually hear from critics that renewables are unreliable, \\nthat it is not always sunny, not always windy. But we are \\nmaking incredible progress at bringing online far more \\nrenewables than just a few years ago people said you could do. \\nIn fact, I just checked my phone, and today, right now, on a \\npeak summer day, California is running 50-percent renewables \\nright now. That is way beyond anything that I was told as a \\nState legislature less than a decade ago that we could achieve.\\n    Talk about the way building out a nationwide and \\ninterconnected transmission system is helping us advance \\nrenewables far beyond all these limitations that we are always \\nbeing warned about.\\n    Ms. Soholt. Thank you, Representative Huffman, for the \\nquestion.\\n    So, yes, I think that our utilities--I would call them \\nout--they have done a fantastic job of bringing renewable \\nenergy online and operating the grid reliably. They have seen \\nthat economic benefit to customers over the long term of adding \\nrenewables. And I am speaking from my experience in the \\nMidwest, where we have an increasing amount of renewables on \\nthe system.\\n    The reason we need to work on the Macro Grid vision is \\nbecause we need to be able to move resources from where they \\nare located to where they can be used. That is not a new \\nphenomenon for the grid. It is just that we need to move the \\nlocation specific resources to where they can be used.\\n    But the grid does many more things than just facilitate \\ninterconnection of renewables. So we are going to get extra \\nbenefits of grid reliability. We are going to get the extra \\nbenefits of reducing prices by lowering congestion costs. We \\nare going to get the additional benefit of communities getting \\ntaxes paid by the utilities and all the jobs and economic \\ndevelopment that come along with the Macro Grid.\\n    And so, you know, I think what I have endeavored to show in \\nmy testimony is that we have a three-fer here--at least a \\ntwofer, maybe a three-fer. We have, you know, a better \\nenvironment through developing and dispatching renewable \\nresources. We have job creation through both the grid and \\nrenewables. And we will be able to compete with China on that \\nvision that they are on right now with having a very \\ncompetitive U.S. through clean, low-cost, renewable \\nelectricity.\\n    But we need to work on the pieces, not only the \\ninfrastructure but the approval processes, the construction of \\nlines. We need to tackle all of the pieces in order to have the \\nbenefits that flow from the Macro Grid.\\n    Mr. Huffman. If I could sneak a few more seconds in, Ms. \\nSoholt, you have talked about the Macro Grid, but we are also \\nusing the built environment to generate a lot of renewables \\nthese days. And so the scare tactics we have heard about the \\namount of land you would need hypothetically for wind and \\nsolar, we have an awful lot of built environment that can be \\ngenerating clean energy in a way that coexists beautifully with \\nother uses.\\n    Could you speak to that?\\n    Ms. Soholt. Yes. Thank you, Representative. I will be \\nbrief.\\n    So I think you are talking about building efficiency and \\ntransportation challenges that we can tackle with electric \\nvehicles to bring down emission rates. There are great promise \\nin all of those things, so, absolutely, couldn't agree more.\\n    Mr. Huffman. And photovoltaic solar generation on top of \\nbuildings and parking lots, et cetera.\\n    Ms. Soholt. Absolutely.\\n    Mr. Huffman. So thank you very much.\\n    I yield back.\\n    Ms. Castor. Thank you.\\n    Representative Brownley, you are recognized for 5 minutes.\\n    Ms. Brownley. Thank you, Madam Chair.\\n    And I, too, want to thank the panel for being here and \\nsharing your expertise and doing the work that you do every \\nsingle day to save our planet. So we appreciate it very, very \\nmuch.\\n    Ms. Soholt, again, on the grid and expansion of the grid--\\nand you mentioned that China is going ahead. China gets to do \\nwhatever they want to do because they are a communist country, \\nand they don't, you know, have environmental impact studies, et \\ncetera, that they have to really sort of deal with.\\n    And I know one of your recommendations in terms of \\nexpanding the grid is about, you know, removing transmission \\nbarriers. So, you know, we had a whole hearing on this 6, 8 \\nmonths or so ago. And, you know, just tell me how you remove \\ntransmission barriers in our country.\\n    I just think that, you know, as we have tried to expand the \\ngrid and connect East and West, you know, it is a process that \\ntakes forever, and, in many cases, the end result is that it \\ndoesn't happen. So if you could enlighten me.\\n    Ms. Soholt. Sure. Thank you, Representative Brownley, for \\nthe question. So we need to do a couple things.\\n    We need some additional good direction from the Federal \\nEnergy Regulatory Commission on transmission planning across \\nthe seams. We have a big challenge right now with connecting \\nthe various power pools together to be able to plan and permit \\nand build transmission across those seams. And the real benefit \\nof doing that is that we are going to be able to deliver \\nsavings and cost-effective clean energy for customers. So it is \\nall about the customer savings as well as the environment, and \\nas well as the other benefits that flow. So we need additional \\ndirection from FERC on planning.\\n    We may need some help from Congress on siting transmission. \\nI think that utilities and States have done a lot to try to \\naddress siting issues. Utilities are really getting out early \\nand often to talk to communities about why additional power \\nlines are needed. We are trying to be very judicious about the \\ntype of lines that are constructed, using our grid the best we \\ncan before we build new, and then using very little new right-\\nof-way, if possible.\\n    So there are different levels of things, but--so I would \\nsay, in the planning process, there are barriers that we have \\nto remove. In the permitting process, we have challenges. And, \\nyou know, Congress needs to work with the states to really \\nunderstand how we can tackle some of the siting and routing \\nissues. And then, you know, we are going to have to figure out \\ncost delegation policy among the beneficiaries of transmission.\\n    So it is a challenging dilemma to solve, but the benefits \\nare simply so great from building the Macro Grid.\\n    Ms. Brownley. Yeah. Yeah.\\n    So I understand the siting challenges. Give me an example \\nof what some of the planning barriers are with regards to FERC. \\nWhat do you mean by that?\\n    Ms. Soholt. Boy, we are going into the weeds here, \\nRepresentative.\\n    So, when we have two regions who are trying to look at what \\nshould be constructed across what we call a seam, they would \\neach do an individual study. And what we need to be able to \\nhave them do is both use the same inputs----\\n    Ms. Brownley. Yeah.\\n    Ms. Soholt [continuing]. So that they can come up with the \\nsame solutions and work on that together.\\n    That doesn't always happen. And so we need some reform to \\nallow the two power pools to work together more effectively.\\n    But the proof is really in, are we getting anything built \\nacross those seams? And, so far, we are not seeing very much \\nprogress.\\n    Ms. Brownley. Thank you. Thank you very much.\\n    My time is about to run out, but, Dr. Baptista, I wanted to \\nask you, you know, as we attempt to try to turn our report \\nrecommendations into actual legislation, are there policy tools \\nthat are better, I guess, at prioritizing the needs of \\nenvironmental justice communities than others?\\n    Dr. Baptista. Well, I think, in terms of tools, much of \\nwhat we looked at in the national climate platform looked at, \\nyou know, where are the existing programs that actually have \\ndone this work well in terms of environmental justice?\\n    And, for example, the U.S. EPA's EJ Small Grants Program, \\nthe Weatherization Assistance Program, you know, some of the \\njob training programs that I mentioned, those are programs that \\nhave effectively reached environmental justice communities and \\nhave been able to collaborate with those stakeholders on the \\nground and create jobs and also return benefits to those \\ncommunities through collaborative processes, not just \\ninvestments.\\n    So I would suggest that we look at some of those existing \\npolicies and programs and look for not only expanding those but \\nto model and replicate in other energy and climate policies \\nthat the plan puts forward.\\n    Ms. Brownley. Thank you very much.\\n    And I apologize for going over my time, Madam Chairwoman, \\nbut I yield back.\\n    Ms. Castor. Well, thank you, Rep. Brownley.\\n    And I would like to thank all the witnesses for joining us \\ntoday.\\n    And now we are going to return to a few housekeeping \\nmatters.\\n    Rep. Graves, you had two--you had reserved the right to \\nobject on two previous UC requests. One is the IRENA report on \\nthe cost of renewables, and the second is on Rep. Casten's \\nClimate Feedback article. Are you going to maintain your \\nobjections on those?\\n    Mr. Graves. Could you remind me, Madam Chair, on the \\nobjection you had on our documents, were those included in the \\nrecord of the hearing, in the last hearing we had?\\n    Ms. Castor. Yes, they were.\\n    Mr. Graves. Okay. In that case, then that is fine. And I \\nwill review the document that Mr. Casten mentioned.\\n    Ms. Castor.

In short, wind turbines are not the greatest threat birds \\nface today; climate change is. Audubon's research\\\\1\\\\ has shown that \\ntwo-thirds of North American bird species are at risk of extinction \\nfrom global temperature rise. To stave off the worst impacts of climate \\nchange, and to protect the ecosystems birds depend on, we need to take \\nadvantage of all forms of clean, cost-effective, renewable energy, \\nincluding onshore and offshore wind power. Transforming the energy \\nsector to 100 percent clean energy--part of our goal to reach net-zero \\nemissions economy-wide by 2050--necessitates widespread deployment of \\nindustrial scale wind, solar, geothermal, storage, and the transmission \\nneeded to bring that energy to market. Audubon's policy is to work with \\nthe industry, agencies, our partners, and our chapter network to \\nachieve that goal.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ https://www.audubon.org/climate/survivalbydegrees\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    All forms of energy--including wind power--have direct and indirect \\nimpacts on birds. While wind energy helps birds on a global scale by \\ncurbing climate change, wind power facilities can harm birds through \\ndirect collisions with turbines and other associated structures, \\nincluding power lines. But it's important to put the risks posed by \\nwind turbines in perspective. An estimated 140,000 to 500,000 bird \\ndeaths occur per year due to turbine collisions, which is substantial, \\nbut significantly less than deaths caused by oil pits and \\ncommunications towers.\\\\2\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\2\\\\ https://www.fws.gov/birds/bird-enthusiasts/threats-to-birds.php\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Beyond direct collisions, wind power facilities can also affect \\nbirds by degrading or destroying habitat, causing disturbance and \\ndisplacement, and disrupting important ecological links. Placing wind \\nprojects in the path of migratory routes makes this problem worse. It \\nis possible to mitigate this problem, however, by consulting with \\nwildlife experts and ecological data to design projects that minimize \\nthese impacts. Wind power is critical to reducing greenhouse gas \\nemissions and other forms of air pollution from fossil fuels--pollution \\nthat disproportionately affects low-income communities and communities \\nof color.\\\\3\\\\ Any level-headed analysis of wind power must look at the \\nwhole picture, which is why Audubon strongly supports wind energy that \\nis sited and operated properly to avoid, minimize, and mitigate \\neffectively for the impacts on birds, other wildlife, and the places \\nthey need now and in the future.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\3\\\\ https://www.naacp.org/climate-justice-resources/fumes-across-\\nfence-line/\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Audubon's role is to make sure that key species and high \\nconservation areas for birds are protected as much as possible and in \\naccordance with federal law.

The MBTA is credited with saving many iconic species from \\nextinction, and today, the MBTA protects most of the country's native \\nbird species--including songbirds, shorebirds, raptors, wading birds, \\nand more--from unauthorized taking or killing. Unfortunately, the \\nAdministration's legal opinion and proposed rule that interprets the \\nMBTA to only apply to purposeful take has put at risk the significant \\nprogress that stakeholders have made in advancing bird conservation \\nrelated to incidental taking.\\n    Under the Act's authority, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and \\nmany industries have come to agreement on simple measures that protect \\nbirds, including the Land-Based Wind Energy Guidelines. We appreciate \\nthat the recent report from members of this Committee has recommended \\nthe passage of the Migratory Bird Protection Act to help ensure that \\nthere continues to be incentives to develop and implement these best \\npractices, and at the same time, create additional legal certainty.\\n    To ensure we continue to make every effort to mitigate the impact \\nto birds of wind turbines--indeed, the impacts from all forms of \\ninfrastructure--we must follow the letter and the spirit of laws like \\nthe MBTA, along with other bedrock environmental laws such as the \\nEndangered Species Act and the National Environmental Protection Act. \\nWeakening safeguards and limiting opportunity for public comment on \\nmajor infrastructure projects will ultimately lead to worse outcomes \\nnot just for birds, but for the wind energy industry as well.\\n    On behalf of the National Audubon Society, I want to thank you and \\nyour staff for holding this hearing, and for all the important work \\nthat the Select Committee has done to date.

Communities across the nation face the compound crises of \\nreduced revenues, increased costs, and aging infrastructure that can \\nexacerbate public health threats. In your testimony, you call for \\nincreased investment in climate resilient water infrastructure to \\naddress unsafe drinking water and climate-related flooding, sea level \\nrise, and drought. What steps should the federal government take to \\nensure that federal infrastructure programs identify the needs of \\nvulnerable communities and engage workers, firms, and community \\norganizations in infrastructure planning, siting and design? How can \\nCongress ensure that federal disaster recovery projects in vulnerable \\ncommunities engage local workers and firms to build back better?\\n\\n    In order to ensure that federal government actions are responsive \\nto community needs, robust stakeholder engagement processes are \\nessential. Processes to gather input on needs of vulnerable communities \\nshould include multiple opportunities and methods through which to \\ngather critical information. Local knowledge should be incorporated \\ninto planning, siting and design of federal infrastructure programs and \\ndisaster recovery projects.\\n    The unequal impacts of climate change have been long understudied \\nand it is imperative that this is remedied. As the federal government \\ndesigns research projects related to disaster recovery and \\ninfrastructure programs, these projects must also collect equity data \\nand incorporate this analysis into planning, siting and design.\\n    One way that the unequal impacts of climate change can be addressed \\nis to ensure that workers from the most impacted communities have \\naccess to the employment opportunities from disaster recovery and \\ninfrastructure programs. We also know that in a transition to a cleaner \\neconomy more jobs can be generated that provide opportunities for \\ncommunities. The Clean Energy Future report found that ``clean energy'' \\njobs require more workers in sectors such as energy efficiency \\nprograms, renewable energy production, and auto manufacturing (making \\nelectric cars). Net job gains increase over time, starting at a little \\nunder 200,000 per year in 2016-2020, and rising to 800,000 per year in \\n2046-2050. The report can be found on the Reference Page of the Clean \\nEnergy Future report. These projected renewable energy and energy \\nefficiency jobs' increases do not ensure that the economic benefits \\nwill go to vulnerable communities. Therefore, it is important for \\nCongress to include policies that directly target benefits for these \\nimpacted communities.\\n    In order to engage local workers and build back better in \\nvulnerable communities, Congress can include provisions to employ local \\nworkers using guidelines that can be embedded or given preference in \\nprograms which receive federal funding such as: community benefits \\nagreements, first source hiring guidelines living wage, paid sick days, \\npreferences for Minority-Owned Business Enterprises and Women-Owned \\nBusiness Enterprises (MBE/WBE) and Ban the Box.\\n    The federal government should also ensure that local community-\\nbased organizations, faith based and civic groups are able to access \\ndisaster relief funds, job training and placement opportunities that \\ncan best connect residents in underserved communities with jobs in \\nrebuilding infrastructure and much needed disaster recovery services. \\nThe Illinois Future Energy Jobs Act\\\\1\\\\ (FEJA) is a good model for ways \\nto ensure that the local community is integrated throughout the \\ndevelopment of the policy, from drafting to implementation.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ https://ilcleanjobs.org/who-we-are/energy-jobs-act/\\n\\n    2. In your testimony, you call for mobilization of new investment \\nin safe and healthy communities through the creation of a National \\nClimate Bank, with at least 60 percent of the Bank capital to be \\ninvested in tribal communities, low-income communities, and communities \\nof color. What additional metrics and criteria should Congress consider \\nas conditions for eligibility or prioritization of investments to \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nensure just, sustainable, and resilient infrastructure investments?\\n\\n    To design a National Climate Bank that will deliver real benefits \\nto low income communities, tribal communities and communities of color, \\nthe Bank must have criteria to support projects that are community-\\ndriven and reflect the needs of the community. In addition, the Bank \\nmust have criteria to ensure that project developers work with local \\nofficials and community leaders to design and implement strategies to \\nreduce the risk of long-time residents being displaced from their \\ncommunities as neighborhood improvements drive up rents. These \\nstrategies could include an expansion of affordable housing; more \\ninclusionary zoning that breaks down long-standing structural barriers \\nand allows for greater housing density; community land trusts to \\nsupport locally owned housing and business assets; and job training \\nprograms to support access to good careers and jobs.\\n    Specifically, the Bank should include the following project \\ncriteria to meet social, environmental, and economic measures:\\n      Lower energy use and costs for residents\\n      Reduce local air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions\\n      Reduce public health risks or damages from more intense \\nheat waves, hurricanes, flooding, other extreme weather events, and sea \\nlevel rise for residents and businesses\\n      Address the needs of the community\\n      Support socio-economic mobility, equitable economic \\nopportunities and affordable access to good jobs, schools, child care, \\nand community services for low-income households, communities of color, \\ntribal communities, women, and/or the disabled\\n      Create good jobs with fair wages and support the local \\neconomy\\n      Reduce the risks that low-income residents are displaced \\nfrom their communities by climate change threats and neighborhood \\nimprovements that drive up rents\\n    For more information on suggested project criteria and other design \\nrecommendations for the National Climate Bank, please see the following \\nreports on the reference page; Florida Future Fund, Building Resilient \\nInfrastructure and Communities Across Florida, tate Future Funds: \\nJumpstarting Investments in Low-Carbon And Resilient Energy and \\nTransportation Infrastructure, Three Bold Actions Congress Should Take \\nto Equitably Address Weather and Climate Disasters.\\n\\n    3. One of the hearing witnesses, Michael Shellenberger, testified \\nthat nuclear power is ``the safest way to make electricity.'' Can you \\ncomment on some of the environmental justice concerns around nuclear \\npower in the United States, including the history of uranium mining?\\n\\n    Nuclear energy is fading in importance globally. The peak in \\nnuclear power's share of global electricity generation was 17.5 percent \\nin 1996. Since then, this fraction has steadily declined reaching 10.1 \\npercent in 2018 and the downward trend is expected to continue. The \\nmost important reason for the decline is that nuclear plants are no \\nlonger financially viable. In the last decade, it has become clear that \\nnot just constructing new reactors, but just operating one has ceased \\nto make economic sense. This is because alternatives to nuclear energy, \\nin particular renewable sources of electricity like wind and solar \\nenergy, have become drastically cheaper. It is for this reason that \\nmany utilities in the United States have required government subsidies \\nto keep operating. Nuclear plants have a long track record of proving \\nmore expensive than initially projected. New nuclear reactor designs \\ntoo are likely to be much more expensive in reality than what studies \\nproject. What are called Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) start off with \\nan economic disadvantage because they lose out on economies of scale. \\nSMR proponents hope that this can be compensated through mass \\nmanufacture and learning, but even under optimistic assumptions about \\nthe rates of learning, hundreds if not thousands of SMRs would have to \\nbe constructed before they break even in costs with large reactors, \\nwhich are themselves not economical.\\n    These economic challenges add to other well-known problems \\nassociated with nuclear energy, in particular, the absence of any \\ndemonstrated solutions to managing radioactive waste in the long run \\nand the potential for catastrophic accidents. No reactor design is \\nimmune to these problems. Efforts to ameliorate one of these problems \\ntypically makes other problems worse. Finally, inasmuch as intermittent \\nrenewables such as solar photovoltaics and wind turbines are becoming a \\nmore important part of the electricity supply, technologies like \\nnuclear power that are best suited for baseload power are going to \\nbecome more redundant. Instead, the need is for flexible sources of \\npower and storage capacity. For all these reasons, and more, it does \\nnot make sense to embark on nuclear energy.\\n    The legacy of nuclear power plants in the United States also speaks \\nto environmental injustice; from sourcing of the uranium, to siting of \\nthe plant, to disposal of the waste. Nuclear Power Plants (NPP) and the \\nsubsequent toxic nuclear waste cause ``transgenerational justice issues \\nof unprecedented duration in comparison to any other industry'' (Dean \\nKyne and Bob Bolin 2016 p.1). Indigenous communities have borne the \\nbrunt of nuclear power's infrastructure in the form of the uranium \\nmining, nuclear test sites and the disposal of nuclear waste which have \\nleft a legacy of pollution and public health harm in these \\nenvironmental justice communities.\\n    Please see the Reference Page for additional information.\\n\\n    4. How can Congress best solicit the input and feedback from \\nenvironmental justice communities on climate and clean energy policy? \\nWhat would the ideal stakeholder engagement process look like during \\nthe development of legislation?\\n\\n    Having a variety of opportunities for stakeholder engagement is \\nimportant to solicit input and feedback from environmental justice \\ncommunities. These opportunities should include systems to support \\nstakeholder engagement in places where there is little to no \\ntechnology. Opportunities for verbal and written feedback, as well as a \\nvariety of public meeting times during and outside of business hours \\nare helpful. Information should also be provided in language accessible \\nto the communities of interest and sufficient time should be allocated \\nfor public comments and feedback. Processes like those used to elicit \\ninput for the House Select Committee's majority staff report and \\nCongressman McEachin and Chairman Grijalva's EJ For All Act are both \\ngreat examples of how to engage stakeholders in legislative processes. \\nThese processes were interactive, took on multiple forms, were \\nconducted with enough early consultation to allow for productive and \\nmeaningful discussions and included the feedback given from \\nstakeholders into the policy design. Often stakeholders are only given \\nan opportunity for feedback when a draft is completed, but having a \\nmore interactive process, with early consultation and a wide breadth of \\ninput supports a wider stakeholder engagement and ultimately a stronger \\npolicy.\\n    Please see the Reference Page for additional information for the \\nbenefits of participatory policy making.\\n                               references\\n    1.

Building thriving communities and a just, clean energy economy \\nwill be accelerated through leadership at the state, regional, and \\nfederal levels. In your testimony, you highlighted the potential for \\nprogress in the State of Colorado through passage of H.B. 1314 and \\nimplementation of the Colorado Just Transition plan. How can Congress \\nincentivize other states to show similar leadership and ensure that \\nstates and communities have a strong federal partner in their planning \\nand investments to diversify their economies, advance community \\nresilience, and support workers through transition?\\n\\n    The state of Colorado has advanced legislation that provides a \\nmodel for achieving these goals. It passed landmark legislation, House \\nBill 1314, during the 2019 legislative session. The legislation, which \\nwas envisioned and championed by the BlueGreen Alliance and our \\npartners, created the first State Office of Just Transition, and \\nmandated creation of a statewide Just Transition plan for coal workers \\nand communities.\\n    The Colorado Just Transition plan recommends structural \\nimprovements to how the state supports rural communities where coal \\nmining or power plants are likely to close. Key to Colorado's plan will \\nbe developing worker support programs that assist impacted workers in \\ntransition to new work. Several states are watching Colorado's \\nimplementation of HB 1314, and considering similar initiatives, but any \\nplan advanced by forward-looking states will have to be supported and \\nsupplemented by additional Federal resources. Federal funding, \\nespecially as the COVID-19 pandemic stretches already thin state and \\nlocal budgets, will be vital to giving coal communities the resources \\nand tools they need to diversify their economies and support their \\nworkers through transition.\\n    America is in the middle of an energy transition. We need to have a \\nconversation about getting ahead of this transition, and we need to do \\nthis now. That's why--alongside partners and allies from coal \\ncommunities across the country--the BlueGreen Alliance participated in \\nthe development of the National Economic Transition platform, which \\noutlines a policy framework and priorities to invest in communities and \\nworkers hit hard by the decline of the coal industry.\\n    One of the key ideas put forward in this platform is the need for a \\nnew federal transition program that would target and expand resources \\nfor affected communities and workers and coordinate across sectors and \\nagencies. We think creating an Office of Economic Transition is key \\nhere--to help synchronize ongoing efforts across the federal government \\nand leverage new public and private sector investments. We think this \\noffice should be guided by an advisory board reflective of affected \\nstakeholder groups and communities, including labor and local leaders.\\n    The platform puts forward seven pillars that are critical to this \\neffort:\\n      1.  Investing in local leaders and long-term economic development \\nplanning.\\n      2.  Expand investments in entrepreneurship and small-businesses \\nin new sectors to help communities diversify and strengthen their \\neconomies.\\n      3.  Providing a bridge of support and pathways to quality in-\\ndemand, family-sustaining jobs for workers, including paid training, \\nguaranteed pensions, relocation assistance, healthcare support, a \\nbridge of wage differential and replacement, and ensuring miners \\nsuffering from black lung disease receive the benefits to which they \\nare entitled.\\n      4.  Reclaiming and remediating coal sites to create jobs while \\ncleaning up the environment.\\n      5.  Improving inadequate physical and social infrastructure.\\n      6.  Addressing the impact of coal company bankruptcies on \\nworkers, communities, and the environment. And\\n      7.  Coordinating across programs to ensure communities have \\naccess to the resources they need. Launching an interagency grants \\nprogram helps ensure affected stakeholders have a voice and empowers \\nlocal communities with federal resources.\\n    More detailed information about how to ensure a just transition for \\ncommunities can be found in the National Economic Transition Platform.\\n\\n    2. The Select Committee Democrats' majority report calls for \\ndeveloping a national strategy for securing critical minerals in the \\nclean energy and electric vehicle supply chain in an environmentally \\nand socially responsible way. Your coalition of environmental and labor \\ngroups has been grappling with this question. What does the BlueGreen \\nAlliance propose to secure the critical materials necessary for a clean \\neconomy?\\n\\n    Numerous metals and minerals are essential components in the \\ntransition to a low-carbon and clean energy future. A May 2020 World \\nBank report found that production of minerals such as lithium and \\ncobalt may need to increase by nearly 500% by 2050 to meet the growing \\ndemand for clean energy technologies. The same report estimates that \\nover 3 billion tons of minerals and metals will be needed for energy \\nstorage and solar/wind power generation.\\\\1\\\\ The U.S. currently lacks a \\nsecure domestic supply of many of these critical materials, as well as \\na strategy to responsibly mine these materials domestically. To secure \\ncritical materials necessary for a clean economy, and to do so in a way \\nthat is environmentally, economically, and socially responsible, the \\nBlueGreen Alliance has proposed the following necessary steps:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/961711588875536384/Minerals-\\nfor-Climate-Action-The- Mineral-Intensity-of-the-Clean-Energy-\\nTransition.pdf\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n          Develop a comprehensive national critical minerals \\nstrategy guided by a commitment to environmentally, economically, and \\nsocially responsible production, reclamation and recycling domestically \\nand worldwide by:\\n            Identifying R&D for recycling and replacements of \\ncritical minerals, as well as chemistry, fundamental material science, \\nand applied R&D for processing and manufacturing of critical minerals.\\n            Design this R&D strategy in coordination with \\nexisting efforts by the Critical Materials Institute (CMI), DOE Office \\nof Science, NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research, NIST, DoD, \\nEPA, and National Laboratories.\\n            Develop a federal program within CMI that supports \\nthe private sector in demonstration, evaluation, testing, and \\ncertification of substitution or alternative materials.\\n            Develop a roadmap that identifies key R&D needs and \\ncoordinates on-going activities for source diversification, and more \\nefficient use and recycling.\\n            Complete technical and economic feasibility studies \\nof the production of critical minerals and related materials from \\nsecondary/unconventional sources.\\n            Establish new public-private partnerships and \\nleverage existing partnerships to address underlying scientific and \\nearly-stage applied research.\\n            Ensure funding for hard rock mining reclamation.\\n          Incentivize and enhance use of responsibly produced \\ncritical minerals and metals by\\n            Utilizing trade, procurement and other measures to \\nenhance domestic and international supply chain accountability.\\n            Set and raise minimum environmental and labor \\nstandards for critical minerals mining.\\n            Develop and adopt a certification process that \\naddress supply chain accountability and corporate, environmental and \\nsocial responsibility.\\n            Ensure U.S. strategic energy, materials and \\ntechnology stockpiles are domestically or responsibly sourced.\\n          Jump-start domestic projects to recycle key strategic \\nmaterials and reduce reliance on these materials in clean technology \\nproduction in conjunction with deployment of innovative circular \\neconomy processes and products.\\n            Investment to spur full-scale domestic projects to \\nresponsibly reuse and recycle strategic minerals and materials as one \\nof several priorities for an industrial bank or revolving loan fund.\\n            Provide and enhance funding through existing loan, \\ngrant, tax, and other clean energy investment incentives for deployment \\nof responsible recycling, and expand or create a new clean technology \\ntax credit for responsible critical materials recycling and \\nreclamation.\\n            Create a critical materials recycling insurance or \\ninvestment guarantee program.\\n    More detailed information on the BlueGreen Alliance's \\nrecommendations to responsibly mine, reclaim, and recycle critical \\nmaterials can be found in our Manufacturing Agenda.\\n\\n    3. The BlueGreen Alliance's Manufacturing Agenda calls for \\ninvesting ``at scale'' in a new generation of American manufacturing. \\nWhat are the key components of that investment?\\n\\n    Worldwide, nations and regions are rushing to capture the economic \\ngains from rapidly growing demand for clean technology. Even as the \\nU.S. joins other nations in deploying clean technology, our ability to \\nmanufacture these technologies is not keeping pace, as we are dependent \\non other nations for critical subcomponents or technology. Failure to \\nbuild the next generation of clean technology here in the U.S. \\nthreatens future jobs and the economy.\\n    We must make a significant national investment now to jumpstart \\ndomestic clean technology manufacturing, secure critical supply chains \\nin the U.S., transform energy--intensive manufacturing in line with \\nachieving net-zero emissions economy-wide by mid-century, and ensure a \\nnew generation of clean and safe industrial development in America. We \\npropose the following steps necessary to invest at scale in American \\nmanufacturing:\\n          Establish and capitalize a major new industrial \\ntransformation bank and/or revolving loan fund to support key domestic \\nclean technology manufacturing priorities and large-scale industrial \\ntransformation and emissions reduction.\\n          Make an increased, sustained, and coordinated \\ninvestment in three critical areas:\\n            Domestic clean technology supply chains. Convert, \\nretool, or establish clean technology manufacturing facilities in the \\nUnited States, sufficient to recapture leadership in critical clean \\nenergy, transportation, infrastructure, efficiency, and climate \\nresilience technology and advanced materials production.\\n            Industrial transformation. Modernize and cut \\nemissions from domestic energy-intensive manufacturing, including \\nimplementing innovative and efficient processes across heavy industry \\nand materials production.\\n            Responsible mining. Establish environmentally, \\neconomically and socially responsible production, recycling, and \\nreclamation of minerals and materials critical to the clean economy.\\n          Invest in, expand, and refocus existing DOE energy \\nand manufacturing loan programs to establish and strengthen domestic \\nclean technology manufacturing and supply chains, and to deploy first-\\nin-class, innovative, and large-scale industrial efficiency and \\nemissions reduction projects.\\n            Fund and prioritize manufacturing conversion grants \\nto secure and transition existing facilities to manufacture emerging \\nclean technology, and to establish and grow domestic clean technology \\nsupply chains.\\n            Enhance tax credits/grants in lieu of credits \\navailable to promote domestic clean technology manufacturing and supply \\nchains.\\n            Enhance tax credits available to spur industrial \\nemissions reductions.\\n            Spur far broader adoption of established efficiency \\ntechnologies, CHP and WHP systems through tax incentives and grants in \\nconjunction with enhanced technical and deployment assistance.\\n    In addition, we need to:\\n          Greatly increase U.S. funding for research, \\ndevelopment, and demonstration (RD&D)--as well as for deployment, as \\ndiscussed in Pillar 1--to levels commensurate with competitor nations \\nand to meet ambitious clean technology leadership and industrial \\ntransformation objectives.\\n          Establish a new DOE Office of Industrial \\nTransformation charged with leading and coordinating DOE's efforts on \\nindustrial innovation and competitiveness consistent with the goal of \\nachieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions economy-wide by 2050.\\n          Execute a robust industrial transformation program, \\nincluding technology development, demonstration, and deployment.\\n          Coordinate, fund, and execute a program to develop \\nrobust and comprehensive supply chains for critical clean technologies \\nin the United States within ten years.\\n          Establish a permanent jobs, labor, and energy \\nworkforce program modeled on the Energy Jobs Strategy Council in the \\noffice of the Secretary of Energy, working in collaboration with DOL \\nand DOT, and with the Office of Economic Impact, Diversity, and \\nEmployment, that specifically targets the labor and workforce needs in \\na transition to a clean energy, technology, and net-zero GHG economy.\\n          Enhance public benefit from publicly funded research \\nand innovation, and\\n          Ensure domestic clean economy manufacturing \\nobjectives are elevated as a primary focus of a proposed National \\nInstitute of Manufacturing. In the event that all U.S. efforts related \\nto manufacturing across government agencies are coordinated through a \\nnew National Institute of Manufacturing, a primary objective of the \\nInstitute should be positioning U.S. manufacturing and workers to lead \\nin the global transition to a clean and net-zero carbon economy.\\n    More detailed information on the BlueGreen Alliance's \\nrecommendations to invest at scale to transform American manufacturing \\ncan be found in our Manufacturing Agenda.\\n\\n    4. How can Congress ensure that taxpayer-funded R&D leads to a more \\nrobust manufacturing sector and clean energy supply chain in the United \\nStates?\\n\\n    In the global race to lead in the next generation of clean \\ntechnology, the U.S. is under-investing in innovation--from basic \\nresearch through translation of innovation into domestic production of \\ninnovative technology. We know that investing in R&D works--U.S. \\ngovernment investments in innovation have launched technological \\ntransformations that led the world and underpinned prosperity and \\ngrowth.\\n    In order to ensure that taxpayer-funded R&D leads to a more robust \\nmanufacturing sector and clean energy supply chain, the BlueGreen \\nAlliance recommends:\\n          Funding and focusing R&D to ensure U.S. innovation is \\ntranslated into domestic manufacturing and supply chains; Enhance \\ndemonstration and technical assistance; sustain successful clean energy \\nand technology programs--from basic research, to commercialization \\npartnerships, to manufacturing and deployment support--and put an \\nenhanced focus on emerging low-and zero-carbon technologies and \\nprocesses, and on labor and community-friendly innovation\\n          Enhance demonstration and technical assistance.\\n          Sustain successful clean energy and technology \\nprograms, from basic research, to commercialization partnerships, to \\nmanufacturing and deployment support, and\\n          Putting an enhanced focus on emerging low-and zero-\\ncarbon technologies and processes, and on labor and community-friendly \\ninnovation.\\n    In addition, innovating to transform U.S. industry should include:\\n          Establishing a new Office of Industrial \\nTransformation at DOE to lead and coordinate DOE's efforts on \\nindustrial innovation and competitiveness consistent with the goal of \\nachieving net-zero ghg emissions economy-wide by 2050.\\n          Executing a robust industrial transformation program, \\nincluding technology development, demonstration, and deployment in \\nfuel, feedstock and infrastructure innovation, and circular economy \\nprocesses and materials redesign.\\n          Coordinating, funding, and executing a program to \\ndevelop robust and comprehensive supply chains for critical clean \\ntechnologies in the U.S. within 10 years.\\n          Establishing a permanent jobs, labor, and energy \\nworkforce program modeled on the Energy Jobs Strategy Council in office \\nof the Secretary of Energy to target the labor and workforce needs in a \\ntransition to a clean energy economy.\\n          Enhancing public benefit from publicly funded \\nresearch and innovation, and\\n          Ensuring domestic clean economy manufacturing \\nobjectives are elevated as a primary focus of a proposed National \\nInstitute of Manufacturing.\\n    We must also ensure that R&D investments are translated into good, \\nfamily-sustaining manufacturing jobs. We can do this by updating and \\nenhancing long-standing Buy America/nand other procurement standards--\\nand ensuring labor and domestic content standards apply to all major \\npublic investments in clean technology deployment. These provisions can \\nplay a critical role not only in strengthening domestic manufacturing \\nand jobs in emerging technology, but in building public support and \\nmomentum for the clean economy.\\n    More detailed information on the BlueGreen Alliance's \\nrecommendations to ensure R&D is translated into a more robust American \\nmanufacturing sector and clean energy supply chain can be found in our \\nManufacturing Agenda.\\n\\n    5. How can the federal government use procurement to support a \\nstrong, clean, fair manufacturing economy across the United States?\\n\\n    Public procurement can play a crucial role in creating demand and a \\nrobust market for clean and advanced technology in America, in spurring \\ndomestic manufacturing of that technology, and in setting a high \\nstandard for the jobs and community benefits our public investments \\nsupport. They also play an important role in spurring near-term demand \\nfor clean technologies and low-carbon products, and sustaining \\nstrategic investments in U.S. manufacturing even when economic times \\nare tough or in the face of other market uncertainty. In order to use \\nprocurement to support a clean, fair, and strong manufacturing economy \\nin the U.S., we need to:\\n          Utilize direct federal--and state and municipal--\\nprocurement to spur demand for clean, fair, safe, and domestically \\nmanufactured clean technology, including for example, boosting \\ngovernment purchases of clean vehicle fleets and net zero building \\ntechnology, innovative community resilience and disaster response \\ntechnology, and innovative domestic energy and grid technology \\nadoption--all in conjunction with domestic content requirements.\\n          Review U.S. strategic energy, materials, and \\ntechnology stockpiles and, if necessary, reform them to ensure they \\nsupport the need for rapid clean energy technology deployment and \\ndomestic manufacturing development, and industrial emissions reduction.\\n          Improve and extend Buy America/n and ensure its \\neffective application to manufactured goods, clean technologies, and \\nmaterials.\\n          Utilize soundly crafted Buy Clean procurement \\npolicies to incentivize and reward clean, low carbon production of \\nenergy intensive materials.\\n          Utilize ``Fair and Responsible'' procurement \\napproaches to enhance labor standards, workers' rights, career \\npathways, equity, and community benefits--and ensure their \\napplicability to manufacturing and manufacturing supply chain.\\n          Ensure all major public spending on clean technology \\ndeployment--such as tax incentives, loans, grants, and bonds--also \\nsupport high labor standards and domestic manufacturing throughout the \\nsupply chain.\\n          Develop and enact the globally leading energy, \\nemissions, and pollution standards necessary to drive demand for clean \\ntechnology production in the United States. Strong domestic energy and \\nemissions standards and a proactive manufacturing agenda go hand in \\nhand to support and sustain manufacturing and manufacturing jobs in the \\nUnited States.\\n    Updating and enhancing long-standing Buy America/n and other \\nprocurement standards--and ensuring labor and domestic content \\nstandards apply to all major public investments in clean technology \\ndeployment--can play a critical role not only in strengthening domestic \\nmanufacturing and jobs in emerging technology, but in building public \\nsupport and momentum for the clean economy.\\n    In addition, we recommend instituting Buy Clean procurement \\nstandards to ensure that federal spending is directed towards the \\ncleanest, lowest-carbon products. Buy Clean standards promote spending \\ntaxpayer dollars on infrastructure supplies and materials that are \\nmanufactured in a cleaner, more efficient, and climate friendly \\nmanner--rewarding companies that are doing things the right way and \\nputting a break on leakage and offshoring of emissions and jobs across \\nthe supply chain.\\n    More detailed information on the BlueGreen Alliance's \\nrecommendations to utilize procurement to spur demand and support a \\nstrong, clean, and fair manufacturing economy can be found in our \\nManufacturing Agenda.\\n                               references\\n    BlueGreen Alliance.

At the hearing, you were accused of ``making stuff up'' and not \\nhaving expertise on climate and energy policy. Unfortunately, you were \\nnot given the opportunity to respond to those attacks. For the record, \\nwould you like to respond to those accusations and to any others that \\nwere lodged against you during the hearing?\\n\\n    Shortly after giving expert testimony to the committee, I had the \\nstartling experience of being attacked by Representatives Sean Casten \\nof Illinois and Jared Huffman of California who used the whole of their \\nallotted time to claim that I am not a real environmentalist, that I am \\nnot a qualified expert, and that I am motivated by money.\\n    Had I been given a chance to respond, I would have noted that I \\nhave been a climate activist for 20 years and an energy expert for 15 \\nyears. In the early 2000s I co-created and advocated for the \\npredecessor to the Green New Deal, the New Apollo Project, which \\nPresident Barack Obama implemented as his $90 billion green stimulus.\\n    My new book, Apocalypse Never, has received strong praise from \\nleading environmental scientists and scholars, including the father of \\nmodern climate science, Tom Wigley, who said, ``This may be the most \\nimportant book on the environment ever written.'' And in early 2020, \\nthe United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change invited me \\nto serve as an expert reviewer.\\n    Finally, I would have noted, I have always been financially \\nindependent of industry interests and disclose my donors on my \\norganization's web site.\\n    But I wasn't given the chance to say any of that. After Casten and \\nHuffman lied about me, Rep. Garret Graves asked the committee's \\nchairperson, Rep. Kathy Castor of Florida, to let me respond. She \\nrefused and abruptly ended the hearing.\\n\\n    2. Ms. Beth Soholt, Executive Director of the Clean Grid Alliance, \\ndisagreed with your testimony on the competitiveness of wind and solar \\nenergy. Specifically, she claimed that unsubsidized wind and solar are \\nthe cheapest and most reliable forms of energy. Would you like to \\nrespond?\\n\\n    Renewable energy advocates propose spending hundreds of billions of \\npublic and ratepayer money on renewable energy, new transmission lines, \\nenergy efficiency, mass transit, electric vehicles, carbon capture and \\nstorage, and advanced nuclear energy. They argue that these federal \\ninvestments will result in millions of good jobs with high pay, and \\nalso pay for themselves through higher economic growth.\\\\1\\\\\\n    But similar programs over the last decade did not result in the \\nbenefits being promised. During the first decade of this century I \\nadvocated a suite of policies nearly identical to the ones currently \\nbeing proposed and watched them fail to create a new manufacturing \\ncapacity, good jobs with high pay, or higher economic growth.\\n    Rather, they resulted in low-wage service sector jobs, greater \\ndependence on imported Chinese technologies, and higher energy costs. \\nAnd they resulted in higher electricity prices and the net transfer of \\nwealth from lower to upper income citizens.\\n    A former Obama administration economist at the University of \\nChicago found last year that consumers in states with renewable energy \\nmandates paid $125 billion more for electricity in the seven years \\nafter passage than they would have otherwise.\\\\2\\\\\\n    Renewables contributed to electricity prices rising six times more \\nin California than in the rest of the US since 2011, the state's \\n``take-off'' year for rapid growth in wind and solar, a price rise that \\noccurred despite the state's reliance during the same years on \\npersistently-low-priced natural gas.\\\\3\\\\\\n    Renewables have the same impact everywhere in the world. They have \\ncaused electricity prices to rise 50 percent in Germany since 2007, the \\nfirst year it got more than 10 percent of its power from subsidized \\nwind, solar, and biomass. By 2019, German household electricity prices \\nwere 45 percent higher than the European average.\\\\4\\\\\\n    Despite investing nearly a half-trillion dollars, Germany still \\ngenerated just 42 percent of its electricity from non-hydro renewables \\nlast year, as compared to the 72 percent France generated from \\nnuclear.\\\\5\\\\ If Germany didn't count emissions-producing and land-\\nintensive fuels like biomass and biofuels as renewable, which most \\nenvironmental groups, even Greenpeace, believe it shouldn't, the share \\nof its electricity from non-emitting, non-hydro renewables is just 34 \\npercent.\\\\6\\\\\\n    Solar and wind make electricity more expensive because they are \\nunreliable, requiring 100 percent backup, and energy-dilute, requiring \\nextensive land, transmission lines, and mining. Solar and wind \\ndevelopers do not pay for the costs they create but rather pass them on \\nto electricity consumers and other producers.\\\\7\\\\\\n    Interest in massively subsidizing renewables comes at a time when \\nindustrial renewable energy projects are being blocked around the \\nworld, as even their boosters now admit. ``Biden plots $2tn green \\nrevolution but faces wind and solar backlash,'' read recent Guardian \\nheadline. ``New York's bold green plans hit opposition,'' reported \\nFinancial Times on September 1, 2020.\\n    Ask yourself why, if renewables are cheaper than existing grid \\nelectricity, do solar and wind developers require $2 trillion from \\nAmerican taxpayers in the form of subsidies?\\n    And why, if renewables are so cheap, do they make electricity so \\nexpensive?\\n    Clean Grid Alliance, for the record, is an industrial wind-energy \\nfunded organization with a direct financial interest in promoting the \\ncontinued subsidization of wind energy.\\n\\n    3. Many of the policies contained in the Biden proposal and the \\nmajority staff report of the committee closely mirror the approach in \\nCalifornia--both in targets and in scope.\\n\\nCan you tell us a little bit about your experience in California about \\nthe impacts of the state's climate policies on jobs, access to jobs, \\nhousing cost and costs--particularly on those who can least afford it--\\nand communities of color?\\n\\n    Renewable energy advocates are basing their climate agenda on what \\nCalifornia, my home state, did, but our electricity rates since 2011 \\nrose six times more than they did in the rest of the US, thanks mainly \\nto the deployment of renewables and the infrastructure they require, \\nsuch as transmission lines. And now, California's big bet on \\nrenewables, and shunning of natural gas and nuclear, is directly \\nresponsible for the state's electricity shortages.\\n    The immediate cause of California's blackouts is a mismatch between \\nelectricity supply and demand. Higher temperatures have led to greater \\ndemand for air conditioning. And California has less electricity, \\nincluding from wind energy, available.\\n    The underlying reason blackouts are occurring is because California \\nlacks reliable, in-state supply. And the reason for that is California \\nhas been closing both natural gas and nuclear power plants.\\n    ``People wonder how we made it through the heat wave of 2006,'' \\nsaid California's electricity grid manager, Caliso's Steven Berberich. \\n``The answer is that there was a lot more generating capacity in 2006 \\nthan in 2020. . . . We had San Onofre [nuclear plant] of 2,200 MW, and \\na number of other plants, totalling thousands of MW not there today.'' \\n\\\\8\\\\\\n    Despite these capacity shortfalls, the state is moving ahead with \\nplans to remove 2,200-MW of reliable electricity from the grid. That's \\nthe amount of power produced by Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant, \\nwhich will be closed in stages in 2024 and 2025.\\n    Renewables advocates have long pointed to batteries as the way to \\nintegrate unreliable renewables onto the grid. Yes, renewables are \\nunreliable, they admit. But if we can store energy collected during \\nperiods of peak capacity, we can parcel it out during periods of peak \\ndemand.\\n    However, batteries are simply not up to the task. One of the \\nlargest lithium battery storage centers in the world is in Escondido, \\nCalifornia. It can only store enough power to service 24,000 of \\nCalifornia's 13,000,000 households.\\n    And it can only do so for four hours. If demand surges for the \\nbetter part of a day, the system will fail. Indeed, for renewables to \\nwork, batteries would need to be able to store the power for weeks and \\nperhaps even months.\\n    ``Batteries don't generate any power,'' said Berberich. ``And \\nduring extended cloud cover over solar fields, we will be in load \\nshedding. We have told the Commissioners again and that solar will need \\nto be overbuilt to serve load and charge batteries at same time.''\\n    People don't sit idly by when electrical systems fail or when \\nreliability flags. Instead, businesses and individuals reach for tried \\nand true methods of powering their day-to-day lives.\\n\\n    4. Last month Mary Nichols, the head of the California agency \\ntasked with climate policies tweeted out:\\n\\n       ``I can't breathe'' speaks to police violence, but it also \\napplies to the struggle for clean air. Environmental racism is just one \\nform of racism. It's all toxic. Government needs to clean it up in \\nwords and deed. We who do climate and environmental policy can and must \\ndo more.''\\n\\n     She quickly deleted that text, but The Two Hundred tweeted in \\nresponse:\\n\\n       ``She wants to cry out ``environmental racism'' when the Enviro \\nideas SHE pushes as President of (CARB) leave the most marginalized \\ncommunities in California to foot the bill AND pushes low-income \\nfamilies out of their neighborhoods'' They go on to say ``that is why \\nwe filed a lawsuit against her racist policies.''\\n\\nWhat do you think will be the impact of nationalizing California \\nclimate policies on jobs throughout the country, particularly the \\nimpact on low income folks and communities of color?\\n\\n    Poor people and people of color are disproportionately impacted by \\nclimate policies that restrict energy consumption.\\n    In May, a California civil rights coalition filed a lawsuit against \\nthe state to prevent implementation of climate law aimed at reducing \\ndriving. The coalition calculates that the proposed law will increase \\nthe cost of a home by anywhere from $40,000 to $400,000.\\n    ``Latino, African American, and Asian American families,'' the \\ncoalition wrote in a letter to the governor, ``are disproportionately \\nvictimized by the confluence of massively destructive state, regional \\nand local housing policy choices.'' \\\\9\\\\\\n    Consider what happened after California closed the San Onofre \\nnuclear plant in 2013. Both carbon emissions and air pollution spiked. \\nAnd air pollution disproportionately harms poor people. This is \\nespecially true in Los Angeles, where poor people of color have borne \\nthe brunt of increased pollution.\\n    From 2011 to 2018, California's industrial electricity prices rose \\n32 percent, while the average price in the other 49 states fell one \\npercent. The good manufacturing jobs in renewables are mostly in China, \\nwhich makes most of the world's solar panels, including America's, \\nwhile the US is stuck with temporary low-wage service jobs installing \\nsolar panels and wind turbines, and doing energy efficiency retrofits.\\n    Now, faced with the electricity supply crisis, Gov. Newsom has \\nsuspended air-pollution regulations, which may increase the use of \\ndiesel generators, and worsen air pollution in the inner-city.\\n    Advocates for renewables claim that solar and wind projects were \\nsomehow part of the battle for environmental justice. In reality, solar \\nand wind projects are imposed on poorer communities and successfully \\nresisted by wealthier ones.\\n    In fact, a major new report found nearly 200 cases of human rights \\nviolations when renewable energy projects were imposed on poor \\ncommunities. In Hawaii and Nebraska, indigenous leaders are resisting \\nwind energy projects that threaten native bird species, including the \\nnene and whooping crane, whose number one cause of mortality is \\ntransmission lines.\\n\\n    5. You're an activist for civil nuclear power--not only because of \\nits air quality and greenhouse gas emissions benefits, but because of \\nthe national security benefits to the United States of having a robust \\nfleet of reactors.\\n\\nDo you believe that the nuclear-related package in the majority staff \\nwould help or harm the U.S. civil nuclear program? And in general, what \\nwould be the impact on greenhouse gas emissions?\\n\\n    The Green New Deal proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and \\nothers last year called for the closure of US nuclear power plants. The \\nwritten statement distributed by the office of Rep. Ocasio-Cortez said, \\n``the plan is to transition off of nuclear.''\\\\10\\\\\\n    And yet study after study finds that closing nuclear plants \\nincreases air pollution and harms public health.\\n    A 2017 study in Nature Energy found that the temporary closure of \\ntwo nuclear plants led directly to lower birth weights, a key indicator \\nof poor health outcomes later in life.\\\\11\\\\ The study found that \\nreduction in birth weight as small as 5.4 percent can result in a lower \\nintelligence quotient and lower income, as well as higher rates of \\nillness, stunted growth, and neurodevelopmental problems.\\\\12\\\\\\n    In response to the Fukushima nuclear accident, the Japanese \\ngovernment shut down its nuclear plants and replaced them with fossil \\nfuels. As a result, the cost of electricity went up, resulting in the \\ndeaths of a minimum of 1,280 people from the cold between 2011 and \\n2014.\\\\13\\\\ In addition, scientists estimate that Japan's nuclear plant \\nclosures resulted in more than four thousand (avoidable) air pollution \\ndeaths per year.\\\\14\\\\\\n    Unreliable electricity from solar and wind energies has been unable \\nto compensate for the loss of reliable, near-zero pollution nuclear \\nenergy. A 2016 study found that the electricity lost from the closure \\nof the San Onofre nuclear plant was mostly replaced by burning natural \\ngas, which increased air pollution in southern California and raised \\nthe costs of generating electricity from natural gas by $350 \\nmillion.\\\\15\\\\\\n    In 2005, Vermont legislators promised to reduce emissions 25 \\npercent below 1990 levels by 2012, but instead the state's emissions \\nrose 16.3 percent, over twice as much as national emissions rose during \\nthe same period, in part due to the closure of the state's sole nuclear \\nplant under pressure from climate activists, and in part due to the \\ninability of unreliable solar and wind to replace lost nuclear energy \\nelectrical generation.\\\\16\\\\\\n    New York State is in the process of closing Indian Point nuclear \\npower plant and replacing it with fossil fuels. Under pressure from \\nelected leaders, Indian Point's operator closed one of its two reactors \\nin April of this year, and intends to close the other one in April \\n2021. In May, a few weeks after calling for a phase-out of nuclear \\nenergy, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez said she wanted to leave ``the door open on \\nnuclear,'' \\\\17\\\\ but five months later called for closing Indian Point \\nnuclear plant.\\\\18\\\\ Environmental and climate justice advocates are \\nprotesting its closure.\\\\19\\\\ They point to a Harvard University study, \\nwhich found that higher air pollution results in higher coronavirus \\ndeath rates.\\\\20\\\\\\n    The US could lose half to two-thirds of its nuclear energy over the \\nnext decade. By 2025, the US will close twelve reactors, which \\nconstitute 10.5 gigawatts of low-carbon power.\\\\21\\\\ This should be \\nextremely troubling for anyone who cares about air pollution and \\nclimate change. Deep decarbonization of US energy supply will require \\nreceiving 100 percent of electricity from zero-emissions sources as \\nwell as replacing all natural gas and petroleum used in transportation, \\ncooking, and heating, which constitute roughly two-thirds of total \\nprimary energy. The cheapest and fastest way to achieve this \\ndecarbonization is to add nuclear reactors at existing nuclear power \\nplants. Closing those plants will foreclose that future option.\\n    Recently, in a major blow to the US nuclear-energy industry, China \\nis reportedly helping Saudi Arabia create a facility to produce uranium \\n``yellowcake'' from uranium ore. The deal is further evidence that \\nAmerica's anti-nuclear energy policies are pushing US allies into the \\narms of our illiberal and undemocratic rivals.\\n    Nations that partner with Russia or China to build nuclear plants \\nare effectively absorbed into their sphere of influence. The line \\nbetween soft power and hard power runs through nuclear energy. On the \\none side is cheap and clean electricity. On the other, a stepping stone \\nto a weapons program.\\n    Some nuclear-industry officials hope that the US will, in the \\nfuture, ``leapfrog'' over China and Russia with smaller ``modular'' \\nreactor designs, micro-reactors, and radical new reactor-coolant \\ncombinations such as those being pursued by Bill Gates. But China and \\nRussia are already far ahead on building and selling small, modular and \\nradical designs, as well as the standard water-cooled ones most nations \\nhave chosen since the 1950s.\\n    The China-Saudi deal should serve as a wake-up call to Congress and \\nthe national-security and nonproliferation community. It's time for the \\nUnited States to realign its policies with the NPT and take action to \\ncompete with the Chinese and Russians.\\n    Nations looking to build nuclear plants will choose partners with \\nexperience building them. To compete, the US must make global nuclear-\\nenergy superiority a national security goal. This starts with either \\ndesignating a new ``national champion'' nuclear building firm or \\ncreating a state-owned nuclear company capable of competing with \\nRussian and Chinese firms.\\n    As part of this effort, Congress should make sure all of today's \\nreactors, including recently shuttered ones, stay open for at least 80 \\nyears. It should also consider amending the Atomic Energy Act to let \\nthe US help nations develop uranium-enrichment facilities, just as \\nChina and Russia do now.\\n    Nuclear power plants, which can operate for 80 years or longer, \\nrequire high-wage, high-skilled, and permanent jobs for multiple \\ngenerations, and yet Democratic policymakers are seeking to shut down \\nnuclear power plants in the U.S.\\n    Congress and the White House must act thoughtfully and \\ndeliberately--but also decisively-- before it's too late.\\n\\n    6. Why do you think many climate activists oppose fossil fuel \\ntechnology innovation when it comes to solving the problem of climate \\nchange?\\n\\n    It is sometimes claimed that environmental or climate policies are \\nrequired for lower pollution, but recent events show that not to be the \\ncase. US electricity sector emissions decreased 34 percent from 2005 to \\n2019, including an astonishing 10 percent in 2019, which is the largest \\nyear-on-year decline in history.\\\\22\\\\ By contrast, the Obama \\nadministration's proposed carbon regulation of the power sector, the \\n``Clean Power Plan,'' proposed emissions reductions of 32 percent-- by \\n2030.\\\\23\\\\ Thanks in large measure to natural gas replacing coal, the \\nInternational Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts carbon emissions in 2040 to \\nbe lower than in almost all of the IPCC scenarios.\\\\24\\\\\\n    Carbon emissions are thus following the same trajectory as other \\nair pollutants. As a result of cleaner-burning coal, the transition to \\nnatural gas, cleaner vehicles, and other technological changes, \\ndeveloped nations have seen major improvements in air quality. Between \\n1980 and 2018, US carbon monoxide levels decreased by 83 percent, lead \\nby 99 percent, nitrogen dioxide by 61 percent, ozone by 31 percent, and \\nsulfur dioxide by 91 percent. While death rates from air pollution can \\nrise with industrialization, they decline with higher incomes, better \\naccess to health care, and reductions in air pollution.\\\\25\\\\\\n    The dominant form of climate policy in international bodies and \\namong nations around the world emerged from 1960s-era environmental \\npolicies aimed at constraining food and energy supplies. These policies \\nare correctly referred to as Malthusian in that they stem from the \\nfears, first articulated by the British economist Thomas Malthus in \\n1798, that humans are at constant risk of running out of food. Real \\nworld experience has repeatedly disproven Malthusianism. If it hadn't, \\nthere wouldn't be nearly eight billion of us. Worse, Malthusian ideas \\nhave been used to justify unethical policies that worsen socioeconomic \\ninequality by making food and energy more expensive, including closing \\ndown nuclear plants.\\\\26\\\\\\n    Policymakers should explicitly reject policies that significantly \\nraise food and energy prices, directly or indirectly. Republicans and \\nDemocrats alike should affirm their commitment to human flourishing and \\nprosperity, both of which depend on cheap food and energy, which depend \\non the rising productivity of inputs to agriculture and electricity \\ngeneration, including labor, land, and capital.\\n    The large reductions in air pollution, including carbon emissions, \\nin recent decades came overwhelmingly from making natural gas cheap, \\nnot from making fossil fuels more expensive. Short-term and focused \\nsubsidies and mandates may help accelerate technological innovation. \\nBut the main focus must be on making the new energy source affordable.\\n\\n    7. In the past, you've talked about the success of the United \\nStates in reducing emissions. In absolute terms since 2005, we've \\nreduced emissions more than the next twelve reducing emissions \\ncountries combined. You credit the vast amount of emissions reduced to \\nour use of nuclear and natural gas. In fact, you've said that natural \\ngas reduced emissions 11 times more than solar energy and 50 percent \\nmore than wind energy in the United States.\\n\\nDo you think the current thinking in the Democratic party and their \\nopposition to fracking make sense as an economics job and a global \\nclimate mitigation strategy?\\n\\n    For nearly a decade, climate activists have claimed that natural \\ngas is worse for the climate than coal,\\\\27\\\\ And yet, on virtually every \\nmetric, natural gas is cleaner than coal. Natural gas emits 17 to 40 \\ntimes less sulfur dioxide, a fraction of the nitrous oxide that coal \\nemits, and almost no mercury.\\\\28\\\\ Natural gas is one-eighth as deadly \\nas coal, counting both accidents and air pollution.\\\\29\\\\ And burning gas \\nrather than coal for electricity requires 25 to 50 percent less \\nwater.\\\\30\\\\\\n    The technological revolution allowing for firms to extract far more \\nnatural gas from shale and the ocean floor is the main reason that U.S. \\ncarbon emissions from energy declined 13 percent between 2005 and 2018, \\nand a big part of the reason why global temperatures are unlikely to \\nrise more than 3 degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels.\\\\31\\\\\\n    Anti-natural gas activists make their claims that coal is better \\nthan natural gas by using an inappropriately short timeframe for global \\nwarming of just twenty years. The United States government and most \\nexperts agree that the appropriate timeframe to use is one hundred \\nyears. Their timeframe thus exaggerates the impact of natural gas as a \\nheat-trapping gas.\\\\32\\\\\\n    Despite a nearly 40 percent increase in natural gas production \\nsince 1990, the EPA reported a 20 percent decrease in methane emissions \\nin 2013, in part because of improved gaskets, monitoring, and \\nmaintenance.\\\\33\\\\ No matter how much methane leaks, natural gas will \\nstill have half the impact of energy on global warming by 2100 as \\ncompared to if the same energy were coming from coal.\\\\34\\\\\\n    Natural gas fracking resulted in the decline 62 percent decline in \\nthe mountaintop mining for coal between 2008 and 2014.\\\\35\\\\ Where \\nfracking for natural gas cracks shale below the Earth's surface, \\nimposing very small impacts aboveground, coal mining devastates \\nmountain ecosystems. More than 500 mountains, covering more than one \\nmillion acres, have been destroyed in central and southern Appalachia \\nby mountaintop removal.\\\\36\\\\\\n    When mining companies demolish mountains with explosives to harvest \\ncoal, they dump millions of tons of crushed rock into nearby valleys, \\ndestroying forests and headway streams. Exposed rock leeches heavy \\nmetals and other toxins, which hurt wildlife, insects, and humans. Dust \\nthat blows into the air from such operations can harm miners and people \\nwho live in nearby communities.\\\\37\\\\\\n    No energy transition occurs without human and environmental \\nimpacts. Fracking brings pipelines, rigs, and trucks, which can disrupt \\npeaceful landscapes that people rightly care about. Frackers have \\ncreated small earthquakes and improperly disposed of fracking \\nwastewater. These problems are serious and should be addressed, but \\nthey are nowhere as bad as coal mining, which has in many ways become \\nworse throughout the decades, not better, culminating in mountaintop \\nremoval and the destruction of river ecosystems.\\\\38\\\\\\n    What explains the lower environmental impact of natural gas \\nfracking as compared to coal mining is power density. A natural gas \\nfield in the Netherlands is three times more power-dense than the \\nworld's most productive coal mines.\\\\39\\\\\\n    Today, many if not most scientists and environmentalists support \\nnatural gas as a substitute for coal. ``People are placing too much \\nemphasis on methane,'' climate scientist Raymond Pierrehumbert told The \\nWashington Post. ``People should prove that we can actually get the \\nCO2 emissions down first, before worrying about whether we \\nare doing enough to get methane emissions down.''\\\\40\\\\\\n    Pollution regulations helped make coal plants more expensive to \\nbuild and operate. But what mattered most was the creation of a more \\npower-dense, abundant, and cheaper alternative.\\n\\n    8. An article published March 19, 2019, by the Institute for En-\\nergy Research (https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/the-grid/\\nwind-\\ngeneration-fails-in-midwest-due-to-weather-events-polar-vortex-and-el-\\nnino/) analyzed the performance of wind generation during acute weather \\nevents and included the following statement,\\n\\n       ``During the polar vortex, wind turbines shut off when \\ntemperatures dipped below minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit. There has been \\nlittle focus on developing wind turbines to operate below minus 20 \\ndegrees Fahrenheit because at these temperatures, there is not much \\nwind blowing. The economics of producing wind energy in such extreme \\nconditions would not justify the additional cost, according to wind \\nexperts.''\\n\\nHow did renewables perform (what percent of capacity was dispatched) \\nduring the polar vortex of 2014 and the polar vortex of 2019 in the \\nregions impacted by each polar vortex?\\n\\nWhen people's health and safety depended on power during the polar \\nvortex, what were the best performing sources of energy?\\n\\n    The consulting firm Wood Mackenzie evaluated the polar vortex that \\noccurred between January 27 to February 2, 2019 and concluded that, \\neven with solar and wind scaled-up to produce the total equivalent \\nquantity of electricity as the grid produces now, millions of people \\nwould have remained without power for several in freezing temperatures. \\n``Any mix of wind and solar to serve load would require long-duration \\nstorage or optimization of multiple 'stages' of shorter duration,`` it \\nfound.\\\\41\\\\\\n    By contrast, nuclear power plants performed exceedingly well during \\nthe polar vortexes. Wood Mackenzie found that ``existing nuclear \\nreduces the magnitude of hourly generation imbalances.'' During the \\npolar vortex, nuclear plants ran with very high ``up-time,'' with just \\none re-fueling outage.\\n    It is notable that nuclear plants out-perform renewables in \\nsituations of high-heat as well. For example, Washington State's \\nColumbia Generating station, a nuclear plant, is under a ``no-touch'' \\norder to generate power during the West's current heat wave.\\\\42\\\\\\n                               references\\n    \\\\1\\\\ Majority Staff Report, ``Solving the Climate Crisis,'' June \\n2020, https://climatecrisis. house.gov/sites/climatecrisis.house.gov /\\nfiles/Climate%20Crisis%20Action%20Plan.pdf\\n    \\\\2\\\\ Michael Greenstone and Ishan Nath, ``Do Renewable Portfolio \\nStandards Deliver?''

As the United States moves toward a national, interconnected \\ngrid, what can the federal government and industry do to ensure that \\nnew transmission lines do not cause unintended environmental harm?\\n\\n    A more nationally interconnected Macro Grid has multiple \\nenvironmental benefits, starting with the connection of abundant, zero-\\nemissions wind and solar resources in remote rural areas to population \\ncenters with high electricity demand. A nationwide, high-voltage direct \\ncurrent (HVDC) network, optimized for the nation's best wind and solar \\nresources, could deliver 80% carbon emission reductions from the grid \\nby 2030.\\\\1\\\\ Furthermore, the decarbonization of our power sector \\nenabled by expanded and enhanced transmission would greatly reduce co-\\npollutants like small particulate matter that lead to an estimated \\n21,000 deaths per year.\\\\2\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\1\\\\ MacDonald, Clack Et Al., ``Future Cost-Competitive Electricity \\nSystems and Their Impact on U.S. CO2 Emissions,'' January \\n25, 2016, https://www.vibrantcleanenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/\\n09/Future_cost-competitive_electricity_syst.pdf.\\n    \\\\2\\\\ Penn, Arunachalam Et Al., ``Estimating State-Specific \\nContributions to PM2.5- and O3-Related Health Burden from Residential \\nCombustion and Electricity Generating Unit Emissions in the United \\nStates'', March 2017, https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/pdf/10.1289/EHP550.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    We expect a very high percentage of future transmission expansion \\nto utilize existing rights-of-way of various types. There are utility \\nrights-of-way all over the country, which in many cases have old lines \\nthat are ready to be replaced. With new technology, including HVDC \\nlines, far more power can be delivered over rights-of-way than in the \\npast.\\n    A critical point about transmission is that, at larger scales, less \\nright-of-way is needed for a given amount of energy delivery. \\nTherefore, it is important to plan ahead of time to build at the size \\nthat will be needed over the long term in order to reduce the amount of \\nright-of-way needed.\\n    Occasionally, new rights-of-way are needed. When new rights-of-way \\nare required, local, state, and sometimes federal permitting processes \\nrequire environmental review prior to being granted permits. The \\nreviews are often very thorough. For example, in New York, Title 16, \\nPart 86 of the New York Compilation of Codes, Rules, and Regulations \\noutlines the several requirements for an interstate transmission line. \\nAn application is required to ``submit detailed maps...[that] shall \\ninclude'' the location of a right-of-way and possible damage to the \\nenvironment as well as historical areas.\\\\3\\\\ Further, the applicant must \\n``submit a statement explaining what consideration, if any, was given \\nto: (1) any alternative route; (2) the expansion of any existing right-\\nof-way...[and] (3) any alternate method which would fulfill the energy \\nrequirements with comparable costs'' where the applicant may compare \\nthe benefits and drawbacks of the alternative.\\\\4\\\\ When lines cross \\nfederal lands, Environmental Impact Statements are required prior to \\nfederal agency permitting. Of course, it is also the case that multiple \\nagency processes without clear accountability can lead to delays, so \\nefforts such as the FAST Act approach to rationalize the process can \\nspeed lengthy approval requirements while protecting the environment.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\3\\\\ N.Y.

For example, ``Smart from \\nthe Start'' transmission planning efforts in the west have engaged \\nwildlife and lands experts along with renewable energy and transmission \\ndevelopers to identify corridors.\\n    Better coordinated interregional and interstate planning can ensure \\nwe have the grid we need to power a clean and thriving economy, while \\nminimizing cost and environmental impact.

How can Congress support or require more efficient use of \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nexisting transmission infrastructure?\\n\\n    Newly available grid-enhancing technologies such as dynamic line \\nratings, power flow control systems, storage-as-transmission, and \\ntopology optimization can reduce congestion and resource curtailment, \\nraising the efficiency of existing transmission infrastructure. Many \\nregions of the country are currently working to understand and \\nincorporate the benefits of these technologies in RTO/ISO tariffs. The \\nEnergy Policy Act of 2005 directs FERC to incentivize the deployment \\nand use of efficiency-improving transmission technologies for the \\nbenefit of electricity consumers. Unfortunately, FERC's recent Notice \\nof Proposed Rulemaking on transmission incentive policy limits the \\nability of the aforementioned, lower-cost grid-enhancing technologies \\nto actually receive these incentives. FERC's proposal is based on a \\nreturn-on-equity approach, which awards utilities greater incentives \\nfor the deployment of more expensive projects, such as power lines. \\nUnder the proposal, for example, a 100 basis point incentive on $1 \\nmillion of equity invested yields only $50,000 in additional \\nearnings.\\\\6\\\\ It is hard to imagine senior utility management even \\nhaving a meeting to discuss an action that could achieve only a $50,000 \\ncontribution to the bottom line, especially when 100 basis points on a \\n$100 million transmission line with potentially similar system benefits \\nwould yield $5,000,000 in additional earnings. Congress should consider \\ndirecting FERC to avoid using an incentive awards methodology that \\npreferences high-cost projects, although new transmission will be \\nneeded in many parts of the country.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\6\\\\ Assuming 50% debt, tax of 27%, debt interest of 5%, target base \\nROE of 10%, O&M rate of 3% and discount rate of 7%.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    A major opportunity for efficient use of our limited rights of way \\nis replacing aging assets with higher capacity lines so that we make \\nmaximum use of corridors. New transmission line conductor technologies \\nare available that increase resilience and energy delivery capability \\nover these paths.\\n    Additionally, expanded wholesale energy markets can help better \\nutilize existing transmission infrastructure by ensuring that \\ngenerators are dispatched over the broadest area in the least-cost \\nmanner. A shared sense of Congress that wholesale energy market growth \\nis beneficial may help encourage utilities and states to consider \\njoining these markets.\\n    Finally, transmission upgrades can vastly improve the efficiency of \\nthe entire electric system. This is because line losses increase \\nsignificantly when power lines operate close to their maximum capacity, \\nand the lines are hot. The Southwest Power Pool calculated that its \\ntransmission upgrades are saving consumers around $100 million from \\nreduced transmission losses,\\\\7\\\\ while the Midwest ISO estimates line \\nloss savings of $200 million to $1 billion dollars in net present value \\ndue to upgrades.\\\\8\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\7\\\\ Southwest Power Pool, ``The Value of Transmission,''\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nhttps://www.spp.org/documents/35297/\\nthe%20value%20of%20transmission%20report.pdf\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\8\\\\ Midwest Independent System Operator, ``MISO Value \\nProposition,''\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nhttps://www.misoenergy.org/about/miso-strategy-and-value-proposition/\\nmiso-value-proposition/\\n\\n    3.

How can adding clean energy to the electric generating mix \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nincrease electric system reliability and resilience?\\n\\n    A diverse mix of resources is key to electric reliability and \\nresilience. Clean energy provides an abundant source of domestic power \\nthat can be rapidly deployed and available even during extreme weather \\nconditions. With zero reliance on global fuel supply, renewable energy \\nsources are not subject to the vagaries of the global marketplace or \\nunexpected changes to fuel availability. Renewable energy can even \\nenhance power reliability under extreme weather conditions, not \\nrequiring fuel supplies that may be disrupted and bouncing back quickly \\nfrom interruptions.\\n    Moreover, as previously described, expanding and upgrading the \\ntransmission system with a 21\\\\st\\\\ century Macro Grid would lower \\nconsumer costs and help prevent outages, thereby enhancing reliability \\nand resilience.\\n    Notably, the Department of Defense is increasingly relying on \\nrenewable energy and energy storage to improve its energy security, \\nenhance readiness and ensure reliable and resilient power for critical \\ndomestic functions and forward operations. For example, the Fort Carson \\nsolar-plus-energy storage project supplies around-the-clock energy \\nresilience to the 4th Infantry Division, the 10th Special Forces Group \\nand 3,400 military family residences. By shifting energy between times \\nof high and low demand, this system also saves taxpayers $500,000 per \\nyear on the installation's utility bill.\\\\16\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\16\\\\ Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, ``Defense \\nSpotlight: Fort Carson Optimizes Energy Storage,'' April 2020, https://\\nwww.citizensfor.com/defense-spotlight-fort-carson-optimizes- energy-\\nstorage/.\\n\\n    6.

A reliable system includes a \\ndiverse portfolio of resources that together meet load at all times. A \\nhigh renewable energy portfolio can be part of a low-cost, low- carbon, \\nreliable power system.\\n    As the share of wind and solar power in the U.S. electricity mix \\nhas grown over time, official metrics indicate that system reliability \\nhas been stable or improved. According to a 2019 report to Congress, \\nwind and solar power increased from 1% of generation in 2008 to 8% in \\n2018, while during the same period 9 of the 13 metrics the North \\nAmerican Electric Reliability Corporation uses to assess reliability \\nwere stable or improved.\\\\44\\\\ In fact, wind and solar have increasingly \\nprovided the majority of generation in different regions without \\nimpacting reliability. At certain points in 2019, wind sources supplied \\n56% of electricity demand in ERCOT and 67.3% of demand in SPP, while \\nsolar supplied 59% of demand in CAISO--with bulk power system \\nreliability being maintained during each of these periods.\\\\45\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\44\\\\ Congressional Research Service, ``Maintaining Electric \\nReliability with Wind and Solar Sources: Background and Issues for \\nCongress,'' June 10, 2019,\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nhttps://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R45764.pdf.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\45\\\\ Ibid.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    In addition to providing low-cost, pollution-free energy, \\nrenewables also deliver a suite of grid reliability services to help \\nkeep the lights on during disturbances, including ride-through \\ncapability, voltage and reactive power control, and flexibility, \\nfrequency regulation, and primary frequency response.\\\\46\\\\ Wind and \\nsolar can also improve power system resilience during extreme weather \\nconditions. Wind's reliability was demonstrated during the 2014 Polar \\nVortex event, when turbines continued to turn even when freezing \\ntemperatures disrupted natural gas pipelines and froze coal piles, \\nrendering many thermal plants inoperable. According to NERC, coal and \\ngas generators made up 81% of power outages during the event.\\\\47\\\\ Wind \\nand solar also remain resilient during heat waves, occurrences that \\nwill only increase in frequency due to a changing climate. As described \\nabove, CAISO CEO Steve Berberich attributed California's rolling \\nblackouts in part to a power plant that ``tripped`` in the high \\nheat,\\\\48\\\\ likely a natural gas plant that shut down during the \\nheatwave,\\\\49\\\\ as natural gas plants often struggle in extreme \\ntemperatures.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\46\\\\ American Wind Energy Association, ``Renewables on the grid: \\nMarket-based solutions \\nsupport reliability,'' https://www.aweablog.org/renewables-grid-market-\\nbased-solutions-support- reliability/.\\n    \\\\47\\\\ Bade, Gavin, ``Polar Vortex set to test Midwest grids amid \\nFERC resilience debate,'' UtilityDive, January 30, 2019, https://\\nwww.utilitydive.com/news/polar-vortex-set-to-test-midwest-grids-amid-\\nferc-resilience-debate/547231/.\\n    \\\\48\\\\ Kahn, Debra and Bermel, Colby, ``California has first rolling \\nblackouts in 19 years--and everyone faces blame,'' Politico, August 18, \\n2020,\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nhttps://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/08/18/california-\\nhas-first-rolling-blackouts-in-19-years-and-everyone-faces-blame-\\n1309757.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\49\\\\ Gilbert, Alex and Bazilian, Moran, ``California power outages \\nunderscore challenge of maintaining reliability during climate change, \\nthe energy transition,'' UtilityDive,\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nhttps://www.utilitydive.com/news/california-power-outages-underscore-\\nchallenge-of-maintaining-reliability-du/583727/.\\n\\n        b.   If MISO were to build wind and solar capacity equal to \\ncapacity needs and resource adequacy in MISO, how much back up natural \\ngas generation would need to be on-line in order to ensure around the \\nclock reliability?\\n\\n    If entities built wind and solar capacity equal to capacity needs \\nand resource adequacy in MISO, then, by definition, no backup would be \\nneeded. As noted above, renewables do not necessarily need to be paired \\nwith non-renewable or ``backup'' sources of energy. Energy storage \\ntechnology, demand response and a robust transmission network can \\nensure that electrons flow across the country at all hours of the day \\nand night. A very low-carbon portfolio can also be achieved with \\nnatural gas included in the resource mix.\\n    4. Capacity factor is a measurement for an energy sources' \\nreliability. According to the chart below (published by the Department \\nof Energy based on EIA data), wind and solar are the least reliable \\nforms of energy (https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/what-generation-\\ncapacity). Do you disagree with EIA capacity factor data?\\n\\n[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]\\n\\n    Respectfully, capacity factor is not a measurement of an energy \\nsource's reliability. A capacity factor is a ratio of energy output \\nrelative to maximum potential output over a period of time. For \\nexample, a car with a top speed of 90 mph that typically cruises on the \\nhighway at a speed of 65 mph and only reaches 90 mph one day a month \\ncould be said to have a capacity factor of only 3%. This does not mean \\nthe car is unreliable. In fact, a typical wind turbine generates \\nelectricity 90% of the time.\\\\50\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\50\\\\ American Wind Energy Association, ``Basics of Wind Energy,'' \\nhttps://www.awea.org/wind-101/basics-of-wind-energy/.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    Additionally, the capacity factors listed in the chart are an \\naggregate of all wind and solar projects. As the technologies continue \\nto improve, so do their capacity factors. For example, according to \\nLawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, ``the average 2019 capacity \\nfactor among [wind] projects built from 2014 through 2018 was 41%, \\ncompared to an average of 31% among projects built from 2004 to 2012 \\nand 25% among projects built from 1998 to 2001.''\\\\51\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\51\\\\ Lawrence Berkley National Lab, ``Wind Technologies Market \\nReport,''\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nhttps://emp.lbl.gov/wind-technologies-market-report/.\\n    Finally, most new utility-scale renewable development is not of \\nsingle-resource projects, but rather hybrid multi-generator or \\ngenerator-plus-energy storage projects that combine the unique benefits \\nof multiple technologies to achieve reliability and economic gains \\nrarely before seen in power generation.\\\\52\\\\ The capacity factors of \\nhybrid resources are absent from the EIA data presented here, but they \\nare by definition higher than any single-resource renewable generator. \\nA hybrid resource that includes energy storage can shift the electrons \\ngenerated by a variable power resource from times of surplus to times \\nof need. A hybrid resource with more than one generator can ensure that \\nit is always producing power from the most available, least costly fuel \\nof the day, be that sunlight, wind or water.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\52\\\\ American Council on Renewable Energy, ``Multi-Resource \\n`Hybrid' Power Plants are the Present and Future of Energy \\nGeneration,'' August 19, 2020, https://acore.org/multi-resource- \\nhybrid-power-plants-are-the-present-and-future-of-energy-generation/.\\n\\n    5. According to the MISO MTEP18 report (https://cdn.misoenergy.org/\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMTEP18%20Book%202%20Resource%20Adequacy 264875.pdf)\\n\\n             ``MISO's ongoing goal is to support the achievement of \\n        Resource Adequacy_to ensure enough capacity is available to \\n        meet the needs of all consumers in the MISO footprint during \\n        all time frames and at just, reasonable rates.''\\n\\n          Resource Adequacy credits in MISO are determined by Module E-\\n        1 tariffs in MISO. This tariff determines the ability of the \\n        source to provide resource adequacy support in MISO. According \\n        to the MISO report titled ``Planning Year 2020-2021 Wind and \\n        Solar Capacity Credit'' published in December 2019 (https://\\n        cdn.misoenergy.org/2020%20\\n        Wind%20&%20Solar%20Capacity%20Credit%20Report408144.pdf), the \\n        system wide capacity credit for wind during the planning year \\n        is 16.6 percent. Can you explain how MISO calculated the 16.6 \\n        percent capacity credit and what it means in terms of winds \\n        capability to meet MISO resource adequacy?\\n\\n    This NREL fact sheet\\\\53\\\\ describes the terms. MISO and other \\noperators use Effective Load Carrying Capability to determine capacity \\nvalue. NERC has defined ELCC in this document.\\\\54\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\53\\\\ https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/57582.pdf\\n    \\\\54\\\\ https://www.nerc.com/files/ivgtf1-2.pdf\\n\\n    6. According to a recent MISO report, MISO has an installed wind \\ncapacity of 20,452MW, yet August 5, 2020 at 2:30pm CST--wind was \\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nproviding only 3,891 MWs of power to the MISO grid.\\n\\n          a.   Why is over 80% of the wind capacity in MISO not \\nproviding power to customers?\\n\\n    Very high penetrations of renewable energy are part of any low-\\ncost, low-carbon, reliable portfolio. Natural gas, coal, nuclear, \\nrenewable, and all resources have planned and forced outages, and \\nexogenous factors that affect their availability. That does not mean \\nthat any single resource or type of resource is available at all times, \\nwhich is why all systems utilize diverse portfolios. States and grid \\noperators need to assemble portfolios that work together to meet load \\nat all times.\\n\\n          b.   Is that normal for the majority of wind capacity in MISO \\nnot to be delivering power at any single point in time in the summer?\\n\\n    Very high penetrations of renewable energy are part of any low \\ncost, low carbon, reliable portfolio. Natural gas, coal, nuclear, \\nrenewable, and all resources have planned and forced outages, and \\nexogenous factors that affect their availability. That does not mean \\nthat any single resource or type of resource is available at all times \\nwhich is why all systems utilize diverse portfolios. States and grid \\noperators need to assemble portfolios that work together to meet load \\nat all times.\\n\\n    7. At 2:30pm CST on August 5, 2020, the LMP in MISO was \\napproximately $25.00. If according to the conversation between you and \\nMr. Casten the marginal cost of wind was $0 and therefore wind would be \\ndispatching at any price over zero, can you explain why over 80% of the \\nwind in MISO is not dispatching when the market was paying $25.00?\\n\\n    Because of the free market, suppliers are not required to sell at \\nany given price. Marginal cost therefore refers to the cost of the \\nsupplier to dispatch electricity, not the price at which the supplier \\nmust sell electricity. When wind dispatches at prices above $0, it \\nearns a profit due to its zero-marginal cost.\\n    Additionally, LMP refers to locational marginal price, a construct \\nthat exists because transmission constraints preclude the formation of \\nany single market price for electricity in MISO at any given time. \\nPrices vary across localized nodes, called LMPs. An expanded and \\nupdated transmission system would go a long way towards reducing this \\nprice variability and deliver the cleanest, lowest-cost power to \\nconsumers.\\n\\n    8. An article published March 19, 2019, by the Institute for Energy \\nResearch (https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/the-grid/wind-\\ngeneration-fails-in-midwest-due-to-weather-events-polar-vortex-and-el-\\nnino/) analyzed the performance of wind generation during acute weather \\nevents and included the following statement,\\n\\n       ``During the polar vortex, wind turbines shut off when \\ntemperatures dipped below minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit. There has been \\nlittle focus on developing wind turbines to operate below minus 20 \\ndegrees Fahrenheit because at these temperatures, there is not much \\nwind blowing. The economics of producing wind energy in such extreme \\nconditions would not justify the additional cost, according to wind \\nexperts.''\\n\\n          a.   How did renewables perform (what percent of capacity was \\ndispatched) during the polar vortex of 2014 and the polar vortex of \\n2019 in the regions impacted by each polar vortex?\\n\\n    In January 2014, freezing temperatures descended upon the Midwest \\nand Eastern regions of the United States, setting a winter peak demand \\nrecord in MISO, SPP, ERCOT, PJM, and NYISO, along with most of the \\nutilities in the Southeast.\\\\55\\\\ During this event, cold temperatures \\ndisrupted natural gas pipelines and froze coal piles and mechanical \\ncomponents at generators, rendering many inoperable.\\\\56\\\\ Fortunately, \\nwind energy output was well above expectations for its contribution \\nduring the peak demand period, helping to keep the lights on for \\nmillions of customers.\\\\57\\\\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    \\\\55\\\\ Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, ``Recent Weather Impacts \\non the Bulk Power System'', January 16, 2014.\\n    \\\\56\\\\ Bade, Gavin, ``Polar Vortex set to test Midwest grids amid \\nFERC resilience debate,'' Utility Dive, January 30, 2019, https://\\nwww.utilitydive.com/news/polar-vortex-set-to-test-midwest-grids-amid-\\nferc-resilience-debate/547231/.\\n    \\\\57\\\\ Goggin, Michael, ``Renewables on the grid: Market-based \\nsolutions support reliability,'' July 19, 2017, https://\\nwww.aweablog.org/renewables-grid-market-based-solutions-support-\\nreliability/.\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    For example, in an assessment of operational events and market \\nperformance, PJM highlighted that wind generation performed well above \\nits capacity for the duration of the event, and performed at nearly 70% \\nof its maximum capacity on January 6th.\\\\58\\\\ Additionally, also on \\nJanuary 6, 2014, the Nebraska Public Power District (NPPD) met record \\nwinter electricity demand as wind provided about 13% of the utility's \\nelectricity.
